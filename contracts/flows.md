# Flows — How to Read and Write Them

Flows are self-contained execution templates. Each flow file defines a complete,
runnable path through the skill tree for a specific use case (MVP, prototype, concept-only, etc.).

**Pipeline.json is removed.** All skill metadata that was in pipeline.json now lives on
the skill nodes inside each flow. Global agent config lives in `skaileup-contracts/agent-config.json`.

---

## Skill Name Convention

Skills are always referenced by their **canonical name** — a flat kebab-case string matching
the `name` field in the skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter. Never use file paths.

```yaml
# correct
skill: "skaileup-datamodel"

# wrong — never use paths
skill: "concept/blueprint/datamodel"
skill: "skaileup-blueprint/skills/30_blueprint/cf_datamodel"
```

The orchestrator resolves names to skill directories by scanning all `SKILL.md` frontmatter
files at startup and building a name→path registry.

### Canonical Skill Registry

| Name                            | Domain                | Description                                             |

## Where Flows Live

| Domain  | Path                               | Flows                                                                     |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Onboard | `skaileup-onboard/flows/`          | `concept-only`, `prototype`, `cli-concept`, `reverse-engineer`            |
| Build   | `skaileup-build/flows/`            | `standard`, `full`, `cli`, `prototype`, `small`, `complex`, `superpowers` |
| Quality | `skaileup-quality/flows/`          | `audit`, `review`, `readiness` (add as needed)                            |
| Schema  | `skaileup-contracts/flow.schema.json` | JSON Schema for all flow files                                            |

Each concept flow ends with a `next_flows` array pointing to the appropriate implementation
(or other follow-on) flows. Use these to chain domains without bundling them into one file.

### Flow Catalogue

**Concept flows** (`skaileup-onboard/flows/`):

| ID                 | Description                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `concept-only`     | Full concept pipeline — brief through screens, components, storybook |
| `prototype`        | Fast concept — brief, brand, features, screens, mockups              |
| `cli-concept`      | CLI concept — brief, features, tech stack, data model (no UI)        |

| `prototype`   | Minimal: scaffold, implement, smoke E2E — fast path for user testing          |
| `small`       | Consolidated scaffold+foundation, features, verify — no test suite            |
| `complex`     | Fully checkpointed setup phases, full test suite                              |

## Tier Presets and `depth_from`

### `tier_presets`

Flows that cover multiple domains define named presets mapping each domain to a depth level.
The user selects a preset at flow start (or a custom per-domain override).

```yaml
tier_presets:
  quick:
    skaileup-research: none
    skaileup-discovery: light
    skaileup-experience: light
    skaileup-prototype: none
    skaileup-storybook: none
    skaileup-blueprint: light
    skaileup-concept-meta: none
  standard:
    skaileup-research: medium
    skaileup-discovery: medium
    skaileup-experience: medium
    skaileup-prototype: light
    skaileup-storybook: none
    skaileup-blueprint: medium
    skaileup-concept-meta: light
  thorough:
    skaileup-research: max
    skaileup-discovery: max
    skaileup-experience: max
    skaileup-prototype: medium
    skaileup-storybook: max
    skaileup-blueprint: max
    skaileup-concept-meta: medium
```

Depth levels: `none` | `light` | `medium` | `max`

### `depth_from` on a node

When a skill node sets `depth_from`, the orchestrator reads the current tier for that domain
and passes it into the skill as the `depth` parameter. This lets a single skill produce
shallower or deeper output depending on the chosen preset.

```yaml
- id: 'overview'
  type: 'skill'
  data:
    skill: 'skaileup-overview'
    depth_from: 'skaileup-discovery' # reads tier.skaileup-discovery at runtime
```

### `skip_when`

`skip_when` accepts a tier expression string. The orchestrator evaluates it against the
resolved tier map and skips the node entirely when the expression is truthy.

```yaml
skip_when: "tier.skaileup-experience in ['none', 'light']"
skip_when: "tier.skaileup-concept-meta == 'none'"
skip_when: "tier.skaileup-storybook == 'none'"
```

The legacy object form is also accepted for boolean flags:

```yaml
skip_when:
  tier_is: none # skip when the node's own domain tier is 'none'
```

## Skill Node — Full Field Reference

```yaml
id: 'datamodel'
type: 'skill'
parentNode: 'g-concept' # visual group container
position:
  x: 840
  y: 200
data:
  # Identity
  skill: 'skaileup-datamodel' # canonical skill name (no paths)
  label: 'Data Model' # display label in editor

  # Execution control
  optional: false # orchestrator may skip if user opts out
  parallel_group: '...' # nodes with same group run concurrently
  subagent: true # run in isolated subagent context

  # Tier / depth
  depth_from: 'skaileup-blueprint' # domain whose tier drives output depth
  skip_when: "tier.skaileup-blueprint == 'none'" # skip expression

  # Conditional extension
  extend_when: "artifact.datamodel.status == 'seed-partial'"
  # When true, skill runs in extend mode — updating an existing artifact
  # rather than generating it from scratch.

  # Location
  writes: '3_blueprint/3_datamodel/'
  # The _concept/ subfolder this skill writes to.
  # Used by the orchestrator for gate checks and UI progress display.

  # Prerequisites
  requires:
    - '2_experience/2_features/'
    - '3_blueprint/1_techstack/stack.md'
  # File or folder paths (relative to _concept/) that must exist on disk
  # before this skill can run. Orchestrator checks these before dispatching.
  # Different from edges — edges express preferred order; requires expresses
  # hard blockers (skill will fail or produce garbage without them).

  # Research grounding
  grounding_folder: 'datamodel/'
  # Subfolder within _grounding/ for this skill's research and user_input.json.

  # User inputs
  user_inputs:
    dialog:
      - id: 'field_id'
        label: 'Human-readable label'
        type: 'text | textarea | select | multiselect | boolean | number'
        required: false
        options: []
        default: null
        hint: 'Help text shown in the UI form'

## Edge Types

| Type          | Meaning                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flow`        | Required sequence — target cannot start until source completes                  |
| `optional`    | Target may be skipped based on user preference or `optional: true` on node      |
| `parallel`    | Source and target can execute concurrently once their own prerequisites are met |
| `review-loop` | Creates an iterative refinement cycle — see Review-Loop Edges section           |

**Edges express preferred execution order. `requires` expresses hard blockers.**
A skill with `requires` checks those paths regardless of which edges reached it.

---

## Node Types

### Skill Nodes

Standard skill execution nodes. Type is `"skill"`. See full field reference above.

### Router Nodes

Router nodes evaluate conditions in order and dispatch to the first matching target.
A `null` target means skip entirely (no downstream node is activated).

```yaml
- id: 'route-prototype'
  type: 'router'
  parentNode: 'g-concept'
  position:
    x: 1360
    y: 200
  data:
    label: 'Prototype Router'
    routes:
      - condition: "tier.skaileup-storybook in ['medium', 'max']"
        target: 'storybook'
      - condition: "tier.skaileup-prototype in ['light', 'medium', 'max']"
        target: 'mock'
      - condition: 'default'
        target: null # skip entirely
```

Conditions are evaluated top to bottom. The first matching condition wins.
Use `"default"` as the catch-all last route.

### Gate Nodes

Gate nodes check artifact status before allowing downstream execution.
When the check fails, `on_fail` controls behavior: `"pause-for-human"` surfaces the
error to the user; `"skip"` silently bypasses the downstream path.

```yaml
- id: 'check-features'
  type: 'gate'
  data:
    label: 'Features Gate'
    check: "artifact.features.status in ['draft', 'approved', 'seed']"
    on_fail: 'pause-for-human'
    message: 'Features artifact required before proceeding.'
```

### Sub-flow Nodes

Sub-flow nodes delegate execution to another flow file and return when complete.
The parent flow resumes from the sub-flow node's outgoing edges.

```yaml
- id: 'run-research'
  type: 'sub-flow'
  data:
    flow: 'research-deep'
    domain: 'skaileup-research'
    pass_context: true
```

### Group Nodes

Group nodes are visual containers for the canvas editor. They have no execution semantics.
Type is `"group"`. Use `parentNode` on child nodes to associate them with a group.

---

## Review-Loop Edges

Review-loop edges create iterative refinement cycles. After the review node runs,
control returns to the `target` node for another pass. The loop continues until
`exit_condition` is satisfied or `max_iterations` is reached.

```yaml
- id: 'e-review-loop'
  source: 'review'
  target: 'overview'
  type: 'review-loop'
  max_iterations: 2
  exit_condition: 'review.score >= 0.8'
  on_exit_fail: 'pause-for-human'
```

`on_exit_fail` controls what happens when max_iterations is reached without satisfying
`exit_condition`:

- `"pause-for-human"` — surface result to user, require manual decision to continue
- `"continue"` — proceed downstream regardless of score

---

## Artifact Handoff

Concept flows pass named artifacts to implementation flows via `next_flows[].artifact_handoff`.
Implementation flows declare which artifacts they consume via `artifact_handoff.from_concept`.

**Concept flow side** (`next_flows` entry):

```yaml
next_flows:
  - id: 'standard'
    domain: 'skaileup-build'
    label: 'Implement →'
    hint: 'Scaffold, implement features with TDD, run tests, and verify.'
    artifact_handoff:
      - features
      - screens
      - datamodel
      - techstack
      - architecture
      - onboarding-decisions
```

**Implementation flow side** (top-level):

```yaml
artifact_handoff:
  from_concept:
    - features
    - screens
    - datamodel
    - techstack
    - architecture
    - onboarding-decisions
```

The orchestrator resolves artifact paths from the concept project directory and makes
them available to all nodes in the implementation flow as read-only inputs.
`onboarding-decisions` carries tech-stack and architectural decisions from the onboarding
dialog — implementation nodes reference these for scaffolding and feature dispatch.

---

## Overrides vs. Edge Ordering

Use `data.overrides.skip_checks` only when a node's prerequisite is guaranteed by the flow
but the gate would still fire because the producer is in a parallel branch with no direct
edge to the consumer. Do **not** use overrides as a shortcut to silence gates that represent
real dependencies, and do **not** add skip_checks for paths guaranteed by direct `flow` edges
— edge ordering is sufficient.

| Situation                                                      | Correct approach                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node B depends on Node A's output and A runs first             | Add a `flow` edge A → B. No override needed.               |
| Node B depends on Node A's output; A runs in a parallel branch | Add `skip_checks` for A's output path in B's `overrides`.  |
| Node B depends on the flow entry node's output                 | Add `skip_checks` for the entry output in B's `overrides`. |
| Gate fires but the file will not exist until user uploads it   | Keep the gate; surface the error to the user. Never skip.  |

---

## Globals and Parameter Merging

At runtime, each node receives a merged parameter object:

```
effective_params = globals + node.data.parameters
```

Node parameters win on conflict. `user_inputs` dialog values are also merged in
(from `_grounding/{grounding_folder}/user_input.json` if already collected).

---

## Modes (Parallel Utilities)

`modes.research` and `modes.standards` are not nodes — they run alongside the graph:

- **research** — fires the research skill in parallel after specified trigger nodes. Results go to `_grounding/general/` and `_grounding/{grounding_folder}/`.
- **standards** — fires once after `trigger_after` node when the flow is running against an existing codebase. Results go to `_standards/`.

---

## Standalone Mode

When a skill is invoked directly (no flow, no orchestrator):

1. Skill reads its `requires` from its own SKILL.md frontmatter
2. Checks each path exists in `_concept/`
3. Runs if gates pass; otherwise names the missing prerequisite
4. On completion, suggests next skills using the orchestrator

See `skaileup-contracts/agent-config.json` for standalone_mode settings.

---

## Writing a New Flow

1. Copy the closest existing flow as a starting point
2. Set `id` (kebab-case, matches filename), `name`, `description`, `meta`
3. Set `version` to `"2.0.0"` for new flows
4. Set `globals` — choose `research_depth`, `approval_mode`, `subagent_mode`
5. Add `tier_presets` — define `quick`, `standard`, `thorough` bundles for each domain the flow touches
6. Configure `modes.research` — which nodes trigger parallel research
7. Add nodes:
   - Every skill node needs at minimum: `skill`, `depth_from` (if tier-driven)
   - Add `skip_when` using tier expressions to make nodes tier-conditional
   - Add `extend_when` for nodes that may operate on existing seed artifacts
   - Add `user_inputs` only for skills that need pre-collection
   - Add `feedback` only for skills that modify upstream files
   - Add `grounding_folder` for skills that save research or user inputs
   - Use router nodes where the flow must branch on tier conditions
8. Add edges — use `parallel` for truly concurrent paths, `optional` for skippable steps
9. Use `review-loop` edges to create iterative refinement cycles
10. Set `entry` to the first node
11. Add `artifact_handoff` to `next_flows` entries (concept flows) or at the top level (build flows)

**Do not** add `overrides.skip_checks` for paths that are guaranteed by direct `flow` edges —
edge ordering is sufficient. Only add `skip_checks` for paths produced by parallel branches
with no direct edge to the consuming node.

## Updating an Existing Flow

When a skill changes its `writes`, `requires`, or `user_inputs`:

- Update the node `data` in **every flow** that includes that skill
- Update MIGRATION.md with what changed and why

When adding a new skill to an existing flow:

- Add the node with full metadata including `depth_from` and `skip_when` where appropriate
- Wire edges from its dependencies and to its dependents
- If it has feedback loops, add the `feedback` field

## Relationship to SKILL.md

Each skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter also declares `user_inputs` — this is the
**standalone default**. Flow node `user_inputs` overrides it for that specific flow context
(e.g., a prototype flow may ask fewer questions than a full-product flow).

The `writes`, `requires`, `grounding_folder`, and `feedback` fields on a skill node
should match the skill's SKILL.md Prerequisites and Outputs sections.
If they diverge, the flow takes precedence at runtime; SKILL.md is documentation.
