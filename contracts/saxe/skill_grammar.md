# Skill DSL Grammar

This document defines the structured language used by all skill files.
Read this once before consuming any DSL-formatted skill.

The agent IS the parser. Keywords are uppercase labels at the start of a
line. Indented lines belong to the preceding keyword. YAML frontmatter
(name, description, keywords) is preserved for skill discovery.

## Keywords

### ROLE

One-sentence identity statement. Defines the agent's scope boundary.

```
ROLE  Data Model agent — produces postxl-schema.json from features.
```

### READS

Input artifacts. Each line: path (glob ok) + brief purpose.
`?` prefix = optional. Stop if required reads are missing.

```
READS
  _concept/1_discovery/1_overview/brief.md          — app name, audience
  _concept/2_experience/2_features/**/*.md          — requirements per feature
  ? _concept/2_experience/1_journeys/stories.json   — user journeys and acceptance criteria
```

### WRITES

Output artifacts. Each line: path + brief description.

```
WRITES
  _concept/3_blueprint/3_datamodel/postxl-schema.json  — PostXL schema
  _concept/3_blueprint/3_datamodel/seed.json           — scenario-based test data
  _concept/3_blueprint/3_datamodel/feature_map.json    — model-to-feature mapping
```

### REFERENCES

Pointers to detailed reference files that explain HOW and WHY.
The DSL says WHAT; references explain the rest.

```
REFERENCES
  shared/contracts/semantic_types.md       — PostXL field type catalog
  shared/contracts/feedback_loop.md        — cross-reference protocol
  references/backend_patterns.md  — custom backend decision tree
```

### REQUIRES

Tool and state prerequisites. `hard:` = fail without. `soft:` = warn and continue.

```
REQUIRES
  hard: pnpm, git, @postxl/cli
  soft: docker (database setup deferred without it)
  state: _concept/3_blueprint/3_datamodel/postxl-schema.json exists
```

### STEP <n>: <title>

Numbered workflow step. Body contains imperative instructions.
Substeps use indented `- ` bullets. Shell commands use `$ ` prefix.

```
STEP 1: Read context
  - Read brief.md for app name and slug
  - Read postxl-schema.json for model count
  - $ pxl validate _concept/3_blueprint/3_datamodel/postxl-schema.json

STEP 2: Confirm with user
  - Present summary: name, model count, branch name
  - Wait for explicit confirmation
```

### RUN

Shell command to execute. Inline within a step, or standalone.
Multiple commands = multiple RUN lines. Use `||` for fallbacks.

```
RUN  pnpm run build
RUN  cd backend && pnpm run test:jest --grep "<feature>"
RUN  pxl validate schema.json || echo "Fix errors above"
```

### OUTPUT <path>

Expected file output with inline template. Shows structure, not full content.

```
OUTPUT _concept/3_blueprint/3_datamodel/postxl-schema.json
  {
    "name": "<app-slug>",
    "models": { "<Model>": { "fields": { ... } } }
  }
```

### EMIT

Observability event. Format: `[skill] event_type key=value ...`

```
EMIT  [implement-1-setup-1-scaffold] started run_id=<uuid>
EMIT  [implement-1-setup-1-scaffold] completed models=N build=passed
```

### CHECKPOINT [<name>]

Human approval gate. Execution pauses until user approves.
Optional name for tracking in PLANS.md.

```
CHECKPOINT feature_spec
  Show the feature spec to the user.
  > "Approve to continue, or tell me what to change."
```

### IF / ELSE

Conditional branch. Condition is a plain-language predicate.

```
IF _concept/2_experience/1_journeys/stories.json exists
  - Read journey acceptance criteria for state transitions
  - Use EARS criteria to derive enum values
ELSE
  - Derive enums from feature requirements
```

### UNTIL <condition>

Repeat the preceding step(s) until condition is met.

```
STEP 6: Implement frontend
  - Build components from screen spec inventory
  - $ pnpm run e2e -- --grep "<feature>"
  UNTIL all E2E tests pass
```

### MUST / NEVER

Hard constraints. MUST = required invariant. NEVER = forbidden action.
Enforced post-hoc by `validate_skill_rules.py` (see below).

```
MUST  write tests before implementation (TDD)
MUST  validate postxl-schema.json before proceeding
NEVER  modify _concept/ files during implementation
NEVER  commit code that does not build
```

**Enforcement:** A Claude Code `PostToolUse` hook runs
`shared/scripts/validate_skill_rules.py` after every skill completes.
The script extracts all MUST/NEVER lines, reads the generated output
files, and calls `claude -p` to validate compliance. Exit code 2 blocks
the agent with a violation report until issues are fixed.

**Authoring tips for reliable enforcement:**

1. **Inline critical rules into STEPs.** A MUST in a consolidated block
   at line 460 competes with 400 lines of procedural steps. Repeat the
   rule inside the STEP where the action happens — redundancy is
   acceptable for compliance.
2. **Keep rule count manageable.** Skills with 30+ constraints see lower
   compliance than skills with <10. Use templates to bake in defaults
   so the rule isn't needed.
3. **Make rules verifiable from files.** Rules like "MUST import X" can
   be checked via grep. Rules like "MUST build without errors" require
   runtime checks — pair these with a RUN command in the CHECKLIST.
4. **Place constraints early.** Skills with constraints before STEP 1
   (lines 24-41) show better compliance than skills with constraints
   after the last step (lines 459+).

### CHECKLIST

Verification items. Agent checks each before proceeding.

```
CHECKLIST
  - [ ] All E2E tests pass
  - [ ] Build succeeds (backend + frontend)
  - [ ] No lint or type errors introduced
  - [ ] Storybook stories render without errors
```

### PROCEDURE <name>

Named reusable sub-procedure. Referenced from steps via `DO <name>`.

```
PROCEDURE snapshot
  - Copy step folder to _concept/.snapshots/<step>_approved/
  - Update _concept/.snapshots/manifest.json
  - Update PLANS.md progress checkbox

STEP 3: Approve features
  CHECKPOINT features
  DO snapshot
```

### PATTERNS

Inline code patterns. Keep minimal — move extended examples to references/.

```
PATTERNS
  # Scoped Playwright locator (avoid sidebar matches)
  await page.locator('main').getByText(/concept/i)

  # Brand token usage (never hardcode colors)
  color: var(--color-primary)
```

## Conventions

- **One keyword per line.** Indented lines are continuation.
- **Steps are sequential** unless wrapped in `IF` or marked `(parallel)`.
- **`?` prefix** on READS/REQUIRES lines means optional.
- **`$ ` prefix** in step body means shell command (equivalent to RUN).
- **`> "..."` in CHECKPOINT** is the prompt shown to the user.
- **`DO <name>`** invokes a PROCEDURE defined elsewhere in the skill.
- Prose explanations belong in REFERENCES files, not in the DSL.
- YAML frontmatter is preserved unchanged for skill discovery tooling.
