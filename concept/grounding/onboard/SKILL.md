# Onboard — Project Identity and Tier Setup

## Overview

The **concept-grounding-onboard** skill is the project initialization agent. It runs a
structured dialog to collect project identity, complexity tier preferences, and
early technology decisions. Outputs are written to `_concept/_grounding/onboarding/`
as machine-readable YAML files consumed by every downstream skill.

This skill does NOT produce `_concept/` pipeline artifacts. It produces grounding
data only — the foundation that all subsequent skills build on.

## When to Use

- Starting a new concept pipeline from scratch
- The orchestrator dispatches this as the first step before any other skill
- The user says "let's start", "new project", "set up onboarding", or "initialize"
- `_concept/_grounding/onboarding/profile.yaml` does not yet exist

## When NOT to Use

- `profile.yaml` already exists and is approved — resume the pipeline instead
- A project brief already exists in `_concept/discovery/` — use the orchestrator to pick up from there
- Adding a feature to a running concept — use `add-feature`

## Prerequisites

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** Read `contracts/concept_structure.md` and
`contracts/iron_laws.md` before starting.

**Hard gates:** None — this is the entry point.

## Context Budget

| Action       | Path                                                                 | Required    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Must read    | `contracts/concept_structure.md`                     | Yes         |
| Must read    | `contracts/iron_laws.md`                             | Yes         |
| Resume state | `_concept/_grounding/onboarding/profile.yaml`                        | If resuming |
| Never load   | `_concept/discovery/`, `_concept/experience/`, `_concept/blueprint/` | —           |

## Standalone Mode

**Gate check:** None — first step.
**On completion:** Present profile summary and suggest next steps (ingest-seeds if the user has material, or the orchestrator to start the pipeline).

NEVER block on optional fields — proceed with defaults if the user skips
NEVER overwrite an existing profile.yaml without user confirmation

EMIT [onboard] started run_id=<uuid>

# -- Phase 0: Resume Check ---------------------------------------------------

STEP 0: Check for existing profile
IF \_concept/\_grounding/onboarding/profile.yaml exists - Read profile.yaml and decisions.yaml - Display a summary: > "I found an existing onboarding profile for [project_name]. > Here's what was collected: > [summary of name, problem, audience, type, tier_preset] > > Would you like to continue from where we left off, update specific answers, > or start fresh?" - IF user says continue → skip to Phase 4 (write files) with existing data - IF user says update → jump to the relevant phase and re-ask those questions - IF user says start fresh → proceed to Phase 1 (overwrite confirmed)
ELSE - Continue to Phase 1

# -- Phase 1: Project Identity -----------------------------------------------

STEP 1: Collect project identity
Ask the following questions one at a time. Wait for each answer before asking the next.
Infer answers from context if the user has already provided them in the conversation.

1. What is the project name? (working title is fine)
2. What problem does this project solve?
   (Ask for a concrete description: who has the problem, what is the pain point?)
3. Who is the target audience?
   (Role, technical skill level, context of use)
4. What type of project is this?
   Options: web-app | cli-tool | api-service | library | data-pipeline | mobile-app
   (Offer examples if the user is unsure)

After all four answers are collected:

> "Got it. You're building a [project_type] called [project_name] for [target_audience],
> solving [brief problem summary]. Does that sound right?"
> UNTIL user confirms

EMIT [onboard] checkpoint phase=identity_collected project=<project_name>

# -- Phase 2: Tier Configuration ---------------------------------------------

STEP 2: Select complexity preset
Present the three presets with brief descriptions:

> "How thorough should the concept pipeline be?
>
> **quick** — focused output, fewer steps, good for prototypes and small tools
> **standard** — balanced depth, recommended for most projects (default)
> **thorough** — maximum depth, all optional phases included, best for complex systems
>
> Which fits your project? (Press Enter for 'standard')"

- Record the chosen tier_preset (default: standard)

STEP 3: Per-domain tier overrides (optional)
IF user chose standard or thorough: > "The preset applies default depths to each pipeline domain. Would you like to > adjust any domain individually? (Skip to use all defaults)"

    IF user wants overrides:
      Present the domain table with preset defaults pre-filled:
      | Domain                | Default (from preset) | Override? |
      |---|---|---|
      | concept-grounding-research     | <preset value>        |           |
      | design    | <preset value>        |           |
      | experience   | <preset value>        |           |
      | walkthrough-mockup    | <preset value>        |           |
      | component-mockup-storybook    | <preset value>        |           |
      | impl-architecture    | <preset value>        |           |
      | ops | <preset value>        |           |

      Valid values per domain: none | light | medium | max
      Collect overrides one at a time; skip domains the user does not want to change.
    ELSE
      Use preset defaults for all domains

EMIT [onboard] checkpoint phase=tiers_configured preset=<tier_preset>

# -- Phase 3: Technology and Architecture Decisions --------------------------

STEP 4: Technology decisions (optional)

> "Do you have early technology preferences? These help downstream skills make better
> recommendations. Skip any you haven't decided yet."

Ask in this order, one at a time:

4a. Framework / language
Prompt: "Do you have a preferred framework or language?"
Examples: Vue, React, Nuxt, NestJS, Python, Go, or 'no preference'
Confidence options: locked | preferred | open

4b. ORM / data access layer
Prompt: "ORM or data access preference?"
Examples: Prisma, TypeORM, Drizzle, SQLAlchemy, or 'no preference'
Confidence options: locked | preferred | open

4c. Database
Prompt: "Database preference?"
Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, or 'no preference'
Confidence options: locked | preferred | open

4d. UI component library
Prompt: "UI component library preference?"
Examples: Shadcn/ui, PrimeVue, Radix, Tailwind only, or 'no preference'
Confidence options: locked | preferred | open

4e. Authentication
Prompt: "Authentication approach?"
Examples: Keycloak, Auth.js, Clerk, custom JWT, or 'no preference'
Confidence options: locked | preferred | open

For each answered item, record: - decision: <the value given> - confidence: <locked|preferred|open> - rationale: <reason given, or null if none>

STEP 5: Brand and architecture decisions (optional)

> "Two more quick questions:"

5a. Existing brand?
Prompt: "Does this project have an existing brand (logo, colors, typography)?"
If yes: "Do you have brand files to share? (images, design tokens, style guide?)"
Record: has_brand: true|false, brand_source: <description or null>

5b. Architecture pattern
Prompt: "Any preference for the overall architecture pattern?"
Examples: monolith, microservices, event-driven, serverless, or 'no preference'
Record: architecture_pattern: <value or null>, confidence: <locked|preferred|open>

EMIT [onboard] checkpoint phase=decisions_collected

# -- Phase 4: Write Outputs --------------------------------------------------

STEP 6: Write profile.yaml

- $ mkdir -p \_concept/\_grounding/onboarding

OUTPUT \_concept/\_grounding/onboarding/profile.yaml
`yaml
    project_name: "<collected value>"
    problem_statement: "<collected value>"
    target_audience: "<collected value>"
    project_type: "<web-app|cli-tool|api-service|library|data-pipeline|mobile-app>"
    tier_preset: "<quick|standard|thorough>"
    tier_overrides:
      concept-grounding-research: "<none|light|medium|max>"
      design: "<none|light|medium|max>"
      experience: "<none|light|medium|max>"
      walkthrough-mockup: "<none|light|medium|max>"
      component-mockup-storybook: "<none|light|medium|max>"
      impl-architecture: "<none|light|medium|max>"
      ops: "<none|light|medium|max>"
    has_brand: <true|false>
    brand_source: "<description or null>"
    created_at: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
    last_updated: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
    `

If a domain had no override, use the preset default value from the Tier Presets table.

STEP 7: Write decisions.yaml
OUTPUT \_concept/\_grounding/onboarding/decisions.yaml
`yaml
    decisions:
      - key: framework
        decision: "<value or null>"
        confidence: "<locked|preferred|open>"
        rationale: "<reason or null>"
      - key: orm
        decision: "<value or null>"
        confidence: "<locked|preferred|open>"
        rationale: "<reason or null>"
      - key: database
        decision: "<value or null>"
        confidence: "<locked|preferred|open>"
        rationale: "<reason or null>"
      - key: ui_library
        decision: "<value or null>"
        confidence: "<locked|preferred|open>"
        rationale: "<reason or null>"
      - key: auth
        decision: "<value or null>"
        confidence: "<locked|preferred|open>"
        rationale: "<reason or null>"
      - key: architecture_pattern
        decision: "<value or null>"
        confidence: "<locked|preferred|open>"
        rationale: "<reason or null>"
    created_at: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
    last_updated: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
    `

Omit keys where the user provided no answer — do not include null-decision entries.

STEP 8: Confirm and hand off
Present a summary to the user:

> "Onboarding complete for **[project_name]**.
>
> Project: [project_type] — [one-line problem summary]
> Audience: [target_audience]
> Pipeline depth: [tier_preset][, with overrides for: <list if any>]
> Decisions locked: [count or 'none yet']
>
> Next steps:
>
> - If you have existing material (docs, designs, code): run `concept-grounding-seeds`
> - Otherwise: run the orchestrator to start the concept pipeline"

## Tier Presets

Preset defaults applied per domain when no override is given:

| Domain                | quick | standard | thorough |
| --------------------- | ----- | -------- | -------- |
| concept-grounding-research     | light | medium   | max      |
| design    | light | medium   | max      |
| experience   | light | medium   | max      |
| walkthrough-mockup    | none  | light    | medium   |
| component-mockup-storybook    | none  | none     | max      |
| impl-architecture    | light | medium   | max      |
| ops | none  | light    | medium   |

## Depth Behavior

This skill's own behavior adapts based on the `depth` parameter:

| Depth    | Behavior                                                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `none`   | Skip this skill entirely — onboarding is assumed complete                                                                            |
| `light`  | Collect Phase 1 (identity) only; use tier_preset defaults; skip Phase 3 decisions                                                    |
| `medium` | Run all four phases (default)                                                                                                        |
| `max`    | Run all four phases; ask follow-up clarifying questions for each decision; validate answers against known constraints before writing |

## Resume Support

If `_concept/_grounding/onboarding/profile.yaml` already exists when this skill starts:

1. Read the existing file and display a summary.
2. Ask the user: continue, update specific fields, or start fresh.
3. If continuing: skip to STEP 6 and re-write both files with existing data plus any corrections.
4. If updating: identify which phase(s) need re-asking, run only those, then re-write files.
5. If starting fresh: confirm intent, then proceed to Phase 1 (overwrite on STEP 6).

## Decision Confidence Levels

| Level       | Meaning                                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `locked`    | Decided and not open to change — downstream skills must use this value      |
| `preferred` | Strong preference but open to recommendation if there's a better fit        |
| `open`      | No preference — downstream skills should recommend based on project signals |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                              | What to do instead                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Asking all questions at once                         | One question at a time — wait for each answer                             |
| Writing null entries to decisions.yaml               | Omit keys where the user gave no answer                                   |
| Using preset defaults without checking for overrides | Apply overrides from STEP 3 before writing tier_overrides in profile.yaml |
| Skipping the resume check                            | Always read profile.yaml first if it exists                               |
| Writing feature or architecture detail               | This skill collects identity and preferences only — nothing more          |

## Integration

- **Called by:** `skaileup-orchestrator` as the first step, or standalone by the user
- **Feeds into:** all downstream skills via `_concept/_grounding/onboarding/profile.yaml` and `decisions.yaml`
- **Hands off to:** `concept-grounding-seeds` (if seeds exist) or `skaileup-orchestrator` (to start pipeline)
