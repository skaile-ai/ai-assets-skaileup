# skaileup-conceptualization

This domain covers everything from initial project discovery through experience design to technical blueprint. Skills in this domain take you from a problem statement to a fully-specified concept ready for implementation.

## Skill Groups

| Group                         | Path                                | Purpose                                                             |

| **discovery**                 | `skills/10_discovery/`              | Project overview, research, brand identity                          |
| **experience**                | `skills/20_experience/`             | Feature specs, user journeys, screen designs, storybook             |

| **ops-add-feature**      | `skills/ops-add-feature/`      | Add a single new feature to an existing concept                     |
| **ops-reverse-engineer** | `skills/ops-reverse-engineer/` | Ingest an existing codebase and produce a full concept              |
| **ops-review**           | `skills/ops-review/`           | Concept quality audit and cross-reference check                     |

## CF vs Saxe Variants

Each group contains `cf/` (Concept Forge) and `saxe/` (Saxe platform) subdirectories.

## Flows

Multi-step flows that chain these skills are in `flows/`:

- `mvp.json` — discovery + experience + blueprint + implementation
- `prototype.json` — concept + screens only
- `concept-only.json` — full concept without implementation
- `cli-app.json` — CLI application variant
- `product.json` — full product with all optional steps

## Output

Skills write to a `_concept/` directory in the project:

```
_concept/
├── 01_project/        → brief.md, goals.md, comparable.md
├── _grounding/        → research findings
