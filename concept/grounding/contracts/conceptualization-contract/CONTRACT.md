# Conceptualization Domain — Shared Contract

**Do not invoke directly.** This is a dependency contract — all `skaileup-conceptualization` skills read this before operating.

## Scope

This contract covers artifacts and conventions that are **conceptualization-specific**.
Structural conventions shared with `skaileup-implementation` live in `skaileup-contracts/contracts/`.

## _concept/ Folder Layout

## Skill Naming Conventions

Skills live in numbered group directories under `skills/`:

| Prefix | Lineage | Example path |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `cf_`  | Concept Forge | `skills/10_discovery/cf_overview/` |
| `saxe_` | Saxe platform | `skills/10_discovery/saxe_overview/` |
| `cf/` subdir | CF variant (pre-merge) | `skills/00_orchestrator/cf/` |
| `saxe/` subdir | Saxe variant (pre-merge) | `skills/00_orchestrator/saxe/` |

Once merged, a skill uses `source: MERGED` and lives in a flat named dir (no `cf/`/`saxe/` subdirs).

## Numbered Group Alignment

Feature groups and screen groups share the same numbering:

```
experience/features/01_user_auth/   ↔   experience/screens/01_user_auth/
```

Skills must preserve this alignment when creating or renaming groups.

## Pipeline Phase Structure

| Phase | Group | Skills involved |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Discovery | `10_discovery` | overview, research, brand-visual, brand-behavioral |
| Experience | `20_experience` | features, behaviors, screens, components, mock, journeys, storybook |
| Blueprint | `30_blueprint` | techstack, architecture, datamodel |
| Add feature | `40_add-feature` | add-feature (post-concept increments) |
| Reverse-engineer | `80_reverse-engineer` | reverse-engineer (existing repo entry) |
| Review | `90_review` | review (gardening + audit) |

## Cross-References

Two-way links are maintained:
- `features[].screens[]` ↔ `screens[].implements[]`
- `datamodel entities` → `features` (via YAML frontmatter `cross_refs`)

## Reads / Writes Protocol

Skills **read from lower-numbered groups** and **write to their own group only**.
No skill writes to a lower-numbered group's files.

## PLANS.md (Concept Phase)

Concept progress is tracked in `_concept/PLANS.md`:

```markdown
# Plans

## Concept Plan: <App Name>
### Settings
- Profile: <name>
- Research depth: skip | light | moderate | deep

### Progress
- [ ] overview — not started
- [x] features — completed YYYY-MM-DD
...

### Decisions
### Open Questions
### Blockers
