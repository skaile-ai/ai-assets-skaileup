# skaileup-storybook

Living Storybook prototypes — full interactive prototypes with component stories, page stories, journey stories, and type definitions. An alternative to simple mockups for teams that want a runnable UI. This domain takes experience artifacts and produces a fully wired Storybook environment that designers and developers can interact with before implementation begins.

Skills will be moved into this domain during the architecture reorganization (Phase 5.2+).

## Building Blocks

| Folder    | Purpose                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `skills/` | Invocable skills (see below) |

## Skills (target)

| Skill                            | Purpose                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `skaileup-storybook/`            | Orchestrates the full Storybook prototype pipeline                |
| `skaileup-storybook-setup/`      | Initializes the Storybook environment and configuration           |
| `skaileup-storybook-types/`      | Generates TypeScript type definitions from concept artifacts      |
| `skaileup-storybook-components/` | Produces component stories from the component catalog             |
| `skaileup-storybook-pages/`      | Produces page stories from screen design artifacts                |
| `skaileup-storybook-journeys/`   | Produces journey stories that wire pages into user flow sequences |

## Conventions

- This domain is an alternative to skaileup-prototype; use when a runnable, interactive UI is required before implementation.
- Run `skaileup-storybook-setup` first; subsequent skills within this domain depend on the initialized environment.
- Depends on `_concept/20_experience/` artifacts; run skaileup-experience skills before invoking this domain.
