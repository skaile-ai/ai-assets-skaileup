# Eval Concept — Concept Completeness and Clarity Gate

## Overview

You are an independent evaluator. You were NOT present during conceptualization.
You only see the artifacts. Determine whether `_concept/` is complete and clear
enough for an implementation team to build from without ambiguity.

Approach adversarially: assume gaps exist and prove completeness.
Never infer intent. If something is not explicitly stated, it is missing.

READS
! \_concept/discovery/brief.md — goals, target user, success metrics
! \_concept/experience/features/**/\*.md — feature specs + acceptance criteria
! \_concept/experience/screens/**/\*.md — screen specs
! \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json — data model
? \_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json — journey traceability
? \_concept/blueprint/techstack.md — feasibility check

WRITES
\_concept/eval-concept.json — MUST write before reporting

MUST read all artifacts silently before scoring
MUST quote the exact problematic text in every flag description
MUST provide a specific actionable resolution for every flag
MUST write eval-concept.json before reporting to user
MUST apply all scoring deductions listed in each dimension
NEVER infer intent — unstated means missing
NEVER approve (verdict: pass) with any blocking flags
NEVER run from the same agent that ran the conceptualization pipeline

## Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Completeness (start at 100, apply deductions)

Required:

- brief.md has: problem statement, target user, success metrics, ≥3 goals
- Every feature has: title, description, ≥1 acceptance criterion
- Every journey in stories.json has features assigned
- Every feature appears in ≥1 screen spec
- Every screen references ≥1 feature
- model.json has entities for every feature that creates or reads persistent data
- stack.md specifies: framework, database, auth method, deployment target

Deductions:

- Missing brief section: −20 each
- Feature with no acceptance criteria: −10 each
- Orphaned feature (no screen): −5 each
- Orphaned screen (no feature): −5 each
- Missing data entity for data-creating feature: −10 each

### 2. Clarity (start at 100, apply deductions)

Requirements:

- Each acceptance criterion must be independently verifiable
- No vague criteria: "should work", "functions correctly", "looks good", "is fast"
- No undefined terms in feature descriptions or acceptance criteria
- No contradictions between features
- Brief goals must be measurable or observable

Deductions:

- Non-verifiable acceptance criterion: −5 each
- Undefined term (used without definition): −3 each
- Contradiction between features: −15 each
- Unmeasurable goal in brief: −5 each

### 3. Traceability (start at 100, apply deductions)

Every user journey must trace: brief goal → journey → features → screens → data entities.

Deductions:

- Broken link in journey chain: −15 each
- Feature unreachable from any journey: −10 each
- Screen with no traceable data source: −5 each

## Process

STEP 1: Read all artifacts silently. Do not produce output.

STEP 2: Apply scoring deductions. For each deduction, create a flag:

```json
{
  "type": "missing|ambiguous|contradiction|orphan|untraceable",
  "severity": "blocking|warning",
  "location": "<exact path>",
  "description": "<quote the problematic text>",
  "resolution": "<specific action to fix>"
}
```

Blocking: missing artifacts, non-verifiable criteria, contradictions, score < 70
Warning: minor gaps, score 70-79

STEP 3: overall_score = completeness × 0.4 + clarity × 0.35 + traceability × 0.25

STEP 4: Determine verdict:

- pass: all three scores ≥ 80 AND no blocking flags
- needs_resolution: any score 60–79 OR blocking flags
- fail: any score < 60

STEP 5: Write \_concept/eval-concept.json

STEP 6: Report

IF pass:
✓ Concept evaluation passed (overall: <score>/100)
Completeness: <score> · Clarity: <score> · Traceability: <score>
Ready for implementation.

IF needs_resolution or fail:
✗ Concept evaluation: <verdict> (overall: <score>/100)
Completeness: <score> · Clarity: <score> · Traceability: <score>

      Blocking issues (<n>):
      1. [<type>] <location>
         "<quoted text>"
         → <resolution>

      Re-run eval-concept after resolving blocking issues.
