# Storybook Components (Sub-skill 2/4)

ROLE Component Builder — identifies custom components not available in the project's component
library, builds them, and creates their Storybook stories.

READS
\_concept/experience/screens/\*_/_.md — UI elements from all screen specs
\_concept/discovery/brand/tokens.json — brand tokens for styling
[passed by orchestrator]: component_library, story_extension, icon_library, component_import

WRITES
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/components/<ComponentName>.<ext>
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/components/index.<ts|js> — barrel export
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/stories/Components/<Name>.stories.<ext>
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/@types/<entity>.<ts|js> — minimal interfaces

REQUIRES
state: \_concept/experience/4_storybook/ exists with passing build (setup sub-skill completed)
state: \_concept/experience/screens/ has at least one screen spec
provided: component_library, story_extension, icon_library (from orchestrator)

EMIT [storybook-components] started run_id=<uuid>

STEP 1: Inventory components across all screen specs

- Read ALL screen specs in \_concept/experience/screens/\*_/_.md
- Extract a DEDUPLICATED list of every UI element mentioned in "UI Elements" sections
- For each UI element, determine:
  a) LIBRARY — available in the project's component_library → use directly in pages, no story needed
  b) CUSTOM — not in library → must be built
- Inspect the installed component_library package to discover its exports:
  $ cat \_concept/experience/4_storybook/node_modules/<component_library>/dist/index.d.ts
  (or index.js — whichever exposes the exports)
- Present the two lists to confirm scope:
  > "Component library (<component_library>) provides: [list]
  > Custom components to build: [list]
  > Does this look right?"
  > EMIT [storybook-components] checkpoint library=<N> custom=<N>

STEP 2: Build types for custom components

- For each custom component, identify data entities its props will reference
- Write MINIMAL interfaces to src/@types/<entity>.<ts|js>:
  - Only include properties the component actually renders
  - Use simple types (string, number, boolean, Date) — no ORM/framework imports
  - Add comment: `// Minimal type for Storybook — replace with generated types after datamodel`
  - Export from src/@types/index.<ts|js> barrel
- If a type file already exists, extend it — don't overwrite

STEP 3: Build each custom component
For EACH custom component:

a) Write src/components/<ComponentName>.<story_extension> - Import types from src/@types/ - Compose from component_library primitives where possible - If no suitable library primitive exists, use plain HTML/CSS with brand tokens - Use icon_library for all icons — never emojis or icon fonts - Apply brand tokens via CSS custom properties (--color-_, --font-_, --radius) - Document props via JSDoc/comments for Storybook autodocs

b) Write src/stories/Components/<ComponentName>.stories.<story_extension> - title: 'Components/<ComponentName>' - Include variant stories as applicable: - Default — standard rendering - AllVariants — all variants/sizes side by side - WithData — populated with realistic domain data - Empty — empty state (if component supports it) - Loading — skeleton/spinner state (if applicable)
IF component appears in multiple screens with different configurations - Add a story variant per unique configuration
MUST use realistic domain-appropriate data — never "Lorem ipsum"

STEP 4: Write barrel export
OUTPUT \_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/components/index.<ts|js> - Re-export all custom components built in Step 3
IF no custom components were built - Write empty barrel with comment: `// No custom components — all from <component_library>` - Create src/stories/Components/README.md explaining this

STEP 5: Verify

- Count component story files:
  $ ls \_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/stories/Components/_.stories._ 2>/dev/null | wc -l
  -> Should equal the number of custom components
  $ cd \_concept/experience/4_storybook && <package_manager> run build
  IF build fails
  - Fix and retry
    EMIT [storybook-components] completed run_id=<uuid> components=<N>

MUST derive components from screen spec "UI Elements" sections — never invent component names
MUST check component_library exports before deciding something is "custom"
MUST use icon_library provided by orchestrator — never hardcode lucide-react or heroicons
MUST use 'Components/<Name>' as the story title prefix
MUST include autodocs tag on all component stories
MUST write src/components/index barrel — the pages sub-skill imports from here
MUST use realistic domain-appropriate data in stories
NEVER create stories for components already available in the component_library
NEVER invent colors or fonts — use CSS custom properties from brand tokens

## Depth Behavior

| Depth    | Behavior                                                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `none`   | Skip this skill entirely                                           |
| `light`  | Minimal setup — hero flow stories only                             |
| `medium` | Standard setup — hero + vital flow stories (default)               |
| `max`    | Full setup — all flows, edge cases, responsive variants, dark mode |

CHECKLIST

- [ ] All screen spec UI elements inventoried and categorized (library vs custom)
- [ ] Minimal types written to src/@types/ for component props
- [ ] Every custom component has a component file in src/components/
- [ ] Every custom component has a stories file in src/stories/Components/
- [ ] src/components/index barrel exports all custom components
- [ ] Icons use the project's icon_library (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Build passes
