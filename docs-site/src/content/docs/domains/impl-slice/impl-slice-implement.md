# Implement Feature — Journey-First Feature Orchestrator

## Overview

Implements features using outside-in TDD at three levels:

1. **Journey level** — write a failing capstone E2E test for the full multi-page flow
   (written before pages start as a contract; verified after all pages are individually green)
2. **Page level** — each page is a vertical slice: write failing tests → implement → green gate
   → regression gate → checkpoint → commit. Never proceed to the next page until tests pass.
3. **Feature level** — each page sub-skill implements individual features with TDD Guard

**Journey-first strategy:** features are built in user-journey order (hero →
vital → hygiene from `stories.json`). This delivers a working end-to-end flow
early and surfaces integration issues before they compound.

**TDD Guard** enforces the Red→Green cycle at the feature level:

- `initial` → only Red declarations permitted
- `writing_tests` → test files editable only
- `red` → test failed; Green declarations permitted
- `making_tests_pass` → only declared prod files editable

See `references/tdd_guard.md` for the full TDD Guard state machine.

**Standalone mode:** call with `feature_id` to implement a single feature
without journey context (useful for `add-feature` follow-through).

## When to Use

- Foundation is complete (app shell exists, auth configured)
- `stories.json` exists (journey-first) OR a specific feature is requested
- User says "implement features", "build the app features", "implement next journey"
- The `implement` orchestrator dispatches this as Phase 4

## When NOT to Use

- Foundation not complete — run `foundation` first
- No implementation plan exists — run `implement` orchestrator first
- Auditing existing code — use `audit`

## Prerequisites

**Hard gates:**

- Project is scaffolded and `foundation` phase is complete
- `_concept/experience/features/` has at least one feature group
- `_concept/experience/screens/` has screen specs
- `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json` exists
- Dev stack is running (frontend + backend accessible)

**Recommended (journey mode):**

- `_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json` exists
- `_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/pages/` exists (UI reference)

# ── Standalone Mode (single feature) ──────────────────────────────

IF feature_id is provided

- Read the specific feature spec
- Find the matching screen spec(s)
- Search for expert skills matching the tech stack
- Write failing tests first (TDD RED)
- Implement the feature (TDD GREEN)
- Verify all tests pass
- Update feature's last_updated in frontmatter
- EMIT [implement-feature] completed feature=<feature_id> tests=<N>

# ── Journey Mode (default) ────────────────────────────────────────

# ── Step 0: Verify dev stack ──────────────────────────────────────

STEP 0: Preflight

- Verify backend is accessible (health check)
- Verify frontend is accessible (health check)
  IF either is not running
  - STOP. Provide exact command to start the missing service.
  - Do NOT proceed until both are running.
- Run existing E2E tests to establish clean baseline
  IF any tests fail
  - STOP. Fix failing tests before starting new work.
    MUST have passing test baseline before any implementation

# ── Step 1: Build journey → page → feature map ────────────────────

STEP 1: Build implementation map

- Read stories.json
- Collect story_maps, ordered by stage: hero first, then vital, then hygiene
- Skip backlog stage
- For each story_map (journey):
  - Collect candidate_screens from its stories
  - Resolve each to a screen spec file in \_concept/experience/screens/
  - For each screen spec, find features whose frontmatter screens[] includes it
  - Deduplicate: a page/feature appears only in the FIRST journey that references it
- Track already-implemented pages/features from progress.json (if resuming)

STEP 2: Present plan

- Show journey order with page and feature counts
- Note pages shared across journeys
  CHECKPOINT journey_plan
  > "Here's how I'll build your app, journey by journey:
  >
  > 1. [Hero] <journey label> — N pages, M features
  >    Pages: <list>
  > 2. [Vital] <journey label> — N pages, M features
  >    ...
  >
  > Each journey gets its own end-to-end tests verifying the full flow.
  > Approve to start with the hero journey."

# ── Step 3–8: Journey loop ─────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 3: Start journey

- Pick next unfinished journey (hero → vital → hygiene)
  $ git checkout implement/<app-slug>
  $ git checkout -b feat/<journey-slug>
  EMIT [implement-feature] journey_start journey=<id> stage=<stage> pages=<N>

STEP 4: Write capstone journey E2E test

- Create e2e/specs/journeys/<stage>-<journey-slug>.spec.<ext>
- Walk the FULL multi-page flow from the story map (contract-first: declares acceptance before any pages exist)
- Use isolated backend / test fixture for data setup
- Reset to populated scenario by default
- One test per story in the journey (serial mode)
- Each test: navigate, act, assert per story acceptance_criteria
- Use test IDs (data-testid) for element addressing
- All journey tests MUST FAIL at this point — that is expected and correct
  $ git commit -m "test: write journey capstone e2e for <journey-label>"
  NOTE: This test is verified at Step 6, NOT here. It declares intent; green gate is after all pages pass.

PATTERNS (adapt to your test framework / language):
describe('<Journey Label>', () => {
beforeAll(async () => { /_ setup: reset DB to populated scenario _/ })
afterAll(async () => { /_ teardown _/ })

    test('<story title>', async () => {
      // Navigate, act, assert per story acceptance_criteria
      // await page.goto('<route>')
      // await expect(page.getByTestId('<element>')).toBeVisible()
    })

})

STEP 5: Implement pages — vertical slice loop

- Read progress.json to find last completed page (resume support)
- For each page in this journey (skip if progress.json marks it complete):

  STEP 5a: Write failing tests for THIS page only
  - Write unit and/or integration tests targeting this page's features
  - If the page is view-only, static, or redirect-only (no meaningful unit tests):
    add a render/smoke test: it('renders without error', ...) and document
    the reason as a comment: // no unit tests: <reason>
  - Run tests — they MUST FAIL at this point
    $ git commit -m "test: write failing tests for page <page-name>"

  STEP 5b: Implement this page
  - RUN implement-feature-page sub-skill with:
    screen_spec path, feature specs for this page, journey context (seed data scenario)

  STEP 5c: Page green gate
  - Run page tests specifically
    MUST be GREEN before proceeding to 5d
    IF any page test is still red: diagnose and fix before continuing

  STEP 5d: Regression gate
  - Run ALL tests (all prior pages + current page)
    MUST all pass before proceeding to 5e
    IF any prior test regressed: diagnose and fix before continuing
    NEVER proceed to the next page with a failing regression

  STEP 5e: Per-page checkpoint
  IF auto_approve_pages is false (default):
  CHECKPOINT page_complete > "Page '<page-name>' complete. > Page tests: N passing. All prior tests: N passing. > Approve to continue to the next page."
  IF auto_approve_pages is true (flow context or dialog): - Skip human approval; log auto-approval in progress.json
  NOTE: 5c and 5d gates still apply regardless of auto_approve_pages

  STEP 5f: Commit and update progress
  - Update progress.json: mark page status = "complete"
    $ git commit -m "feat: implement page <page-name>"
    EMIT [implement-feature] page_complete journey=<id> page=<page-name> tests=<N>

- Repeat for each page

STEP 6: Verify capstone journey E2E test

- Run the journey capstone E2E test written in Step 4
- All pages are individually green at this point — this step catches multi-page integration issues
- Diagnose cross-page issues (navigation, shared state, data flow between pages)
- Fix integration issues
- Re-run ALL tests to ensure no regressions
  UNTIL journey capstone passes AND all prior tests still pass
  $ git commit -m "feat: complete journey <journey-label>"
  EMIT [implement-feature] all_tests journey=<id> total=N passed=P failed=F

STEP 6a: Spec compliance review (REQUIRED before quality review)

- Read each feature spec in this journey against the actual code produced, line by line
- Assume the implementer "finished suspiciously quickly" — do not trust passing tests alone
- Verify: every requirement in the spec is present in the code, not just implied
- Verify: acceptance criteria (EARS) are all addressable by a test
- If any requirement is missing or misimplemented:
  - Fix it now. Do NOT proceed to quality review with an incomplete spec.
  - Re-run tests after the fix.
- Record result: COMPLIANT | NON_COMPLIANT (with list of gaps)
  EMIT [implement-feature] spec_review journey=<id> result=<COMPLIANT|NON_COMPLIANT> gaps=<N>

STEP 6b: Code quality review (only runs after spec compliance passes)
IF spec compliance result is NON_COMPLIANT → fix gaps, repeat STEP 6a
ELSE - Check test coverage: all feature code paths have at least one test - Check file boundaries: no feature bleeds into another's files - Check naming: matches golden_principles conventions - Check no debugging artifacts (console.log, TODO, commented-out blocks) remain - If issues found: fix and re-run tests
EMIT [implement-feature] quality_review journey=<id> result=<PASS|FAIL> issues=<N>

STEP 7: Journey checkpoint
CHECKPOINT journey_complete > "Journey '<journey-label>' is complete. Users can now: > [describe what this journey enables in plain language] > > Tests passing: journey (N), pages (N), features (N). > > Approve to continue to the next journey."

STEP 8: Merge journey branch
$ git checkout implement/<app-slug>
$ git merge --squash feat/<journey-slug>
$ git commit -m "feat: implement <stage> journey — <journey-label>"
$ git branch -d feat/<journey-slug>

- Update progress.json: journey → complete
  EMIT [implement-feature] journey_complete journey=<id> stage=<stage>

STEP 9: Repeat for remaining journeys
UNTIL all journeys (hero + vital + hygiene) are complete

STEP 10: Final check

- Run ALL E2E tests one final time
- Run full build + lint for backend and frontend
  EMIT [implement-feature] completed journeys=<N> pages=<N> features=<N> tests=<N>

CHECKLIST

- [ ] Journey → page → feature map derived from stories.json
- [ ] All journeys processed in stage order (hero → vital → hygiene)
- [ ] Journey e2e tests pass for each completed journey
- [ ] All page and feature tests pass (no regressions)
- [ ] Build passes (backend + frontend + lint)
- [ ] _slice/impl/<slice_id>/progress.json updated

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                                | What to do instead                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Implementing pages before journey tests                | Always write failing journey tests first                            |
| Numeric feature-group order instead of journey order   | Use stories.json stage order: hero → vital → hygiene                |
| Not running regression tests after each page           | Run ALL tests after each page, not just the current journey         |
| Skipping spec compliance and going straight to quality | Spec compliance must pass before quality review — both are required |
| Running quality review on a misbuilt feature           | Fix spec gaps first; quality review on wrong code is wasted work    |
| Screenshot assertions in tests                         | Use data-testid + value assertions only                             |
| Modifying `_concept/` files                            | concept is read-only — update last_updated only via feedback loop   |

## Integration

- **Called by:** `implement` orchestrator or standalone
- **Dispatches to:** `implement-feature-page` (per page)
- **Reads:** `_concept/experience/` (journeys, features, screens, storybook)
- **Writes:** E2E test files, `_slice/impl/<slice_id>/progress.json`
