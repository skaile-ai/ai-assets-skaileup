# Test Plan — Concept-Driven Test Generation

## Overview

Generates a structured test plan from the concept specifications. Reads features,
screens, data model, and seed data to produce test scenarios for every feature,
covering happy paths, error states, edge cases, and permission boundaries. Output
is a single plan file at `_concept/testing/test_plan.md`.

## When to Use

- After features, screens, and data model are approved — to define what needs testing
- Before implementation begins — to establish acceptance criteria upfront
- Before `e2e` — to have a structured test script to follow
- When the user says "test plan", "what should we test", or "generate test scenarios"

## When NOT to Use

- For running actual tests — use `e2e` (browser) or `verify` (spec fidelity)
- For generating test code — use `test-unit` or `test-integration`
- For auditing existing test coverage — use `audit`
- When features are still in draft — wait for approved specs first

## Prerequisites

**Hard gates:**

1. Feature specs must exist in `_concept/experience/features/`
2. Screen specs must exist in `_concept/experience/screens/`
3. Data model must exist at `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json`

Recommended (not blocking): `seed.json`, `experience/behaviors/*.allium`

## Shared Contracts

Before starting, read:

- `skaileup-contracts/contracts/concept_structure.md` — valid \_concept/ paths
- `skaileup-contracts/contracts/frontmatter.md` — feature frontmatter fields
- `skaileup-contracts/contracts/feedback_loop.md` — cross-reference protocol
- `skaileup-contracts/contracts/seed_data.md` — scenario-based seed data convention
- `skaileup-contracts/contracts/iron_laws.md` — non-negotiable constraints

## Context Budget

| Source                                    | Priority |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `_concept/discovery/brief.md`             | Required |
| `_concept/experience/features/**/*.md`    | Required |
| `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json` | Required |
| `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/seed.json`  | Required |
| `_concept/experience/screens/**/*.md`     | Required |
| `_concept/experience/behaviors/*.allium`  | Optional |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Context and Apply Scope Filter

1. Read `_concept/discovery/brief.md` — app overview
2. Read `_concept/experience/features/**/*.md` — all feature specs
3. Read `_concept/experience/screens/**/*.md` — all screen specs
4. Read `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json` — entities, relationships, field constraints
5. Read `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/seed.json` — named scenarios (if exists)
6. Read `_concept/experience/behaviors/*.allium` — behavioral rules (if exists)

Apply `test_scope` filter:

- `must-have-only`: include only features where `priority: must-have`
- `all-features`: include all features regardless of priority

### Step 2: Generate Scenarios Per Feature

For each in-scope feature, produce four scenario categories:

#### Happy Path

What happens when everything works correctly.

- One scenario per requirement checkbox in the feature spec
- Map to `populated` seed data scenario
- Include expected UI state from screen spec

#### Error States

What happens when things go wrong.

- One scenario per error state documented in the feature spec
- Include form validation failures (derive from model.json field constraints)
- Include API error responses (network, auth, server)
- Map to `edge_cases` seed data scenario where applicable

#### Edge Cases

Boundary conditions and unusual inputs.

- Empty states (map to `empty` seed data scenario)
- Maximum length inputs (derive from model.json field types)
- Special characters in text fields
- Concurrent operations (if relevant)
- First-time user vs. returning user (map to `single_user` scenario)

#### Permissions (if roles exist)

Role-based access control scenarios.

- One scenario per role defined in feature's `roles:` field
- What each role CAN do (positive test)
- What each role CANNOT do (negative test)
- If `.allium` files exist, derive from `facing` clauses

### Step 3: Map Scenarios to Seed Data

For each scenario, specify which seed data scenario and entities to use:

```markdown
| Scenario                 | Seed Scenario | Entities                 | Setup Notes        |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Login with valid creds   | populated     | user (admin@example.com) | Pre-seeded user    |
| Login with invalid creds | populated     | —                        | Use wrong password |
| Dashboard empty state    | empty         | —                        | No data seeded     |
| Task list overflow       | edge_cases    | task (100 items)         | Pagination test    |
```

### Step 4: Calculate Coverage Summary

```
## Coverage Summary

| Feature | Happy | Error | Edge | Permissions | Total |
|---------|-------|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| Login | 3 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 11 |
| Dashboard | 5 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 11 |
| Settings | 2 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 5 |
| **Total** | **10** | **7** | **7** | **3** | **27** |
```

### Step 5: Write Test Plan

Write `_concept/testing/test_plan.md`:

```yaml
---
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
scope: all-features # or must-have-only
feature_count: N
scenario_count: N
seed_data_mapped: true
---
```

Structure the file:

```markdown
# Test Plan

## Scope

[must-have-only | all-features] — N features, N scenarios

## Coverage Summary

[table from Step 4]

## Feature: <Name>

### Happy Path

- [ ] **Scenario name** — Description. Route: /path. Seed: populated.
      Expected: [outcome]. Evidence: [what to check].

### Error States

- [ ] **Scenario name** — Description. Trigger: [how to cause error].
      Expected: [error message/behavior].

### Edge Cases

- [ ] **Scenario name** — Description. Seed: edge_cases.
      Expected: [outcome].

### Permissions

- [ ] **Scenario name** — Role: admin. Expected: [access granted/denied].

## Seed Data Requirements

[table from Step 3]
```

### Step 6: Present Summary

Show the coverage summary table and ask:

> "Test plan generated with N scenarios across N features. Review the plan at
> `_concept/testing/test_plan.md`. Would you like to adjust scope, add
> custom scenarios, or proceed?"

## Outputs

- `_concept/testing/test_plan.md` — the complete test plan

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                           | What to do instead                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Writing test code instead of a plan               | This skill produces a markdown plan, not executable tests         |
| Ignoring seed.json scenarios                      | Map every scenario to a named seed data scenario                  |
| Only testing happy paths                          | Require at least 1 error + 1 edge case per feature                |
| Inventing requirements not in specs               | Every scenario must trace to a feature requirement or screen spec |
| Skipping permissions when roles exist             | If `roles:` has multiple entries, generate permission scenarios   |
| Testing nice-to-have when scope is must-have-only | Respect the `test_scope` user input                               |
