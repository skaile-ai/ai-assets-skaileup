# design

Produces the visual and verbal identity of a product: design tokens consumed by all downstream skills, and copy guidelines consumed by implementation. Agents use this domain after the concept brief is approved and before screens or implementation begin.

## Skills

- **design-brand-visual** (`brand-visual/`) — Discovers aesthetic direction, extracts palettes from reference URLs, and writes `_concept/discovery/brand/identity.md` + `tokens.json` + `brandbook.html`.
- **design-brand-voice** (`brand-voice/`) — Defines tone of voice, error messages, empty states, and micro-copy patterns; writes `_concept/discovery/brand/behavioral.md` + `copy_guidelines.md`.
- **design-inspiration** (`inspiration/`) — Standard/complex pass after brand-visual; collects layout, color, typography, and component references consistent with the chosen tokens; writes `_concept/_grounding/research/design-inspiration.md` (design-inspiration-v1).

## When to Use

- `_concept/discovery/brief.md` exists and is approved, but `_concept/discovery/brand/` is empty or incomplete.
- User mentions "brand", "colors", "fonts", "tokens", "visual identity", or "tone of voice".
- Concept tier is `mvp` or higher and at least one downstream skill (screens, mockup, scaffold) needs `tokens.json`.

## When NOT to Use

- Brief does not exist yet — run `concept-brief` first.
- Project is an API-only service with no UI — skip design entirely.
- Tokens already exist and user only wants to tweak values — edit files directly.

## Sequence

`design-brand-visual` must run before `design-brand-voice`: voice requires `identity.md` and `tokens.json` as hard gates. `design-inspiration` also runs after `design-brand-visual` (hard gate on `tokens.json`), in the standard/complex high-level pass.

```
design-brand-visual  →  design-brand-voice
                     →  design-inspiration   (standard/complex)
```

Both skills can be skipped via `depth: none`.

## Cross-references

- `../contracts/concept_structure.md` — canonical `_concept/` path rules every skill reads.
- `../contracts/frontmatter.md` — required frontmatter fields for brand artifacts.
- `../experience/` — `screens` and `components` read `tokens.json` produced here.
- `../impl-architecture/` — scaffold and theming setup consume `tokens.json`.


## Skills in this domain

- [design-brand-visual](./design-brand-visual/) — Use when the project brief is approved but no visual brand exists. Discovers aesthetic direction through plain-language questions, extracts 
- [design-brand-voice](./design-brand-voice/) — Use when the visual brand exists and you need to define communication tone, error message style, empty state messaging, micro-copy guideline
- [design-inspiration](./design-inspiration/) — Use on standard-app / complex-app concepts after brand-visual, to collect concrete visual references — layout patterns, color/typography dir
