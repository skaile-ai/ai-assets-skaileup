# Tech Stack — Stack Selection

## Overview

The **techstack** skill is the Tech Stack Advisor. It helps the user choose the
right tools for their project through plain-language questions. It discovers
available stacks at runtime from `impl-architecture/templates/*/TEMPLATE.md` and recommends
the best match based on the user's answers.

The `tech_stack_skill` field written to `stack.md` is the single reference all
downstream skills use to find implementation recipes.

## When to Use

- The project brief exists and no tech stack has been chosen
- The user says "tech stack", "framework", "what should we build with", "database choice"
- The user wants to change or re-evaluate the tech stack
- The orchestrator dispatches this after the project brief is approved

## When NOT to Use

- `_concept/blueprint/techstack.md` already exists and is approved
- No project brief yet — run **overview** first
- The user already has a codebase — use **audit** or **reverse-engineer** instead

## Prerequisites

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** Read `contracts/concept_structure.md` and
`contracts/frontmatter.md` before proceeding.

**Hard gate:** `_concept/discovery/brief.md` must exist.

## Context Budget

| Action           | Path                                                            | Required                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Must read        | `_concept/discovery/brief.md`                                   | Yes                              |
| Must read        | `impl-architecture/templates/*/TEMPLATE.md`                        | Yes (stack discovery)            |
| Check if present | `_concept/experience/features/**/*.md`                          | No (complexity signals)          |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/overview/user_input.json`                  | No (complexity + pre-answers)    |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/research/onboarding.md`                     | No (skip pre-answered questions) |
| Never load       | `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/`, `_concept/experience/screens/` | —                                |

## Standalone Mode

**Gate check:** `_concept/discovery/brief.md` must exist.
**On completion:** Present stack summary and suggest next steps (architecture, datamodel).

ROLE Tech Stack Advisor — discovers available profiles, recommends the best match,
and writes `_concept/blueprint/techstack.md`.

READS
\_concept/discovery/brief.md — app name, description, audience
impl-architecture/templates/_/TEMPLATE.md — available stack profiles (discovered at runtime)
? \_concept/experience/features/\*\*/_.md — feature requirements (complexity signals)
? \_concept/\_grounding/overview/user_input.json — complexity field + pre-collected answers
? \_concept/\_grounding/research/onboarding.md — pre-answered tech preferences

WRITES
\_concept/blueprint/techstack.md — full stack definition with tech_stack_skill reference

REFERENCES
contracts/concept_structure.md — valid \_concept/ paths
contracts/frontmatter.md — stack.md frontmatter fields
references/integration_categories.md — additional integration checklist

MUST discover available stacks from impl-architecture/templates/ at runtime — never hardcode
MUST include tech_stack_skill field in stack.md frontmatter — downstream skills depend on it
MUST include Additional Integrations section in stack.md
MUST include Trade-offs Considered section in stack.md
NEVER skip user review — tech stack is a high-impact decision
NEVER use stack-specific types or output in stack.md (no SQL, no Prisma schema)

EMIT [techstack] started run_id=<uuid>

STEP 1: Read context

- Read brief.md for the app description, audience, and domain
- Check \_grounding/overview/user_input.json for complexity and any pre-answered tech preferences
  IF \_grounding/research/onboarding.md exists
  - Read onboarding notes — skip questions already answered there
    IF experience/features/ exists
  - Read feature files to gauge complexity signals

STEP 2: Discover available stacks

- Scan impl-architecture/templates/\*/TEMPLATE.md
- For each found profile, read:
  - The Identity table (name, framework, UI library, backend, database, etc.)
  - The "When to Use" section
- Build a comparison table of all discovered profiles

EMIT [techstack] checkpoint phase=stacks_discovered count=<N>

STEP 2b: Determine involvement level

- Read complexity from \_grounding/overview/user_input.json (default: standard)
  IF complexity is "small"
  - > "I'll pick a stack based on your features. I'll show you what I chose. Want to review the options instead?"
  - Proceed in automatic mode: use complexity signals + brief to recommend, skip to STEP 4
    IF complexity is "complex"
  - > "The tech stack is a key decision for your app. I recommend we go through it together — or I can propose something and you review?"
  - Default to involved mode → continue to STEP 3
    ELSE (standard)
  - > "Would you like to pick a tech stack together, or should I recommend one based on your features?"

STEP 3: Ask plain-language questions (involved mode)

- If user_inputs were pre-collected, use them and skip those questions
- Otherwise ask one at a time:
  1. Do you or your team have experience with a framework? (Vue, React, Python, or starting fresh?)
  2. Is this a web app, mobile app, desktop tool, or API only?
  3. How data-heavy is your app? (lots of tables/lists vs. mostly content/forms)
  4. Do you need a content management system or admin panel?
  5. Do you want to manage your own server, or prefer hosted/cloud?
  6. Any budget constraints? (self-hosted = no monthly cost, cloud = pay-as-you-go)
- Adjust next question based on each answer

STEP 4: Recommend

- Based on answers + discovered profiles, select the best matching profile
- Present the recommendation:
  > "Based on your answers, I recommend:
  >
  > **[profile-name]** — [frontend] + [UI library] + [backend] on [database].
  >
  > Why:
  >
  > - [reason 1 tied to user's answer]
  > - [reason 2 tied to feature signals]
  > - [reason 3 tied to preference]
  >
  > Want me to go with this, or would you like to change anything?"
- If user wants a stack not in the discovered list, note it as custom and set tech_stack_skill: custom

STEP 5: Ask about additional integrations

- Reference features/ to identify likely integrations (if present)
- Ask one round covering integration categories from references/integration_categories.md:
  - Payment gateways (Stripe, Mollie, etc.)
  - Email / SMS services (SendGrid, Resend, Twilio, etc.)
  - File storage (S3-compatible, cloud, local)
  - Analytics / error tracking (PostHog, Sentry)
  - Domain-specific (AI/ML APIs, search, maps, PDF)
- Frame questions around existing features where possible:
  > "I see a billing feature — do you need a payment gateway like Stripe?"
- If no integrations needed, document "None identified"

EMIT [techstack] checkpoint phase=preset_recommended tech_stack_skill=<profile-id>

STEP 6: Write stack file

- $ mkdir -p \_concept/blueprint

OUTPUT \_concept/blueprint/techstack.md

STEP 7: Human approval
CHECKPOINT stack_approved > "Your app will be built on [stack name]. > [If integrations found]: It will connect to [services] for [purposes]. > [If no integrations]: No external services needed — everything is self-contained. > > Technical details (if interested): > [Frontend / UI / Backend / Database / Auth] > Additional integrations: [list or none] > > Approve to continue, or tell me what to change."

UNTIL user explicitly approves

STEP 8: Hand off

> "Tech stack approved. Next steps:
>
> - Run `architecture` to document the system design
> - Run `datamodel` to design the data schema
> - Run `concept-orchestrator` to continue the full pipeline"

## Depth Behavior

| Depth    | Behavior                                                                          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`   | Skip this skill entirely                                                          |
| `light`  | Key decisions only — technology names, brief rationale                            |
| `medium` | Standard documentation — decisions with reasoning, diagrams, trade-offs (default) |
| `max`    | Comprehensive documentation — full ADRs, alternative analysis, migration paths    |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                           | What to do instead                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hardcoding stack details without reading profiles | Always scan impl-architecture/templates/\*/TEMPLATE.md — new profiles may have been added. |
| Omitting `tech_stack_skill`                       | This field is mandatory — all downstream skills depend on it.                           |
| Recommending without asking                       | Always ask the user, even if the answer seems obvious. Framework preference matters.    |
| Skipping Trade-offs Considered                    | Always explain what was weighed. Tech stack is a high-impact long-term choice.          |
| Writing Prisma schema or SQL in stack.md          | stack.md is documentation only. Stack translation happens in the datamodel skill.       |

## Integration

- **Called by:** `concept-orchestrator` or standalone (parallel track after overview)
- **Requires:** `_concept/discovery/brief.md`
- **Feeds into:** `architecture`, `datamodel`, `scaffold`, `mock` — all read `tech_stack_skill` from stack.md
