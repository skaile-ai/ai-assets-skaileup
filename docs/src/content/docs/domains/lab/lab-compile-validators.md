# Compile Validators — Validator Generator

## Overview

Reads SKILL.md rule blocks (MUST, NEVER, CHECKLIST) and generates fast Python
validator scripts that check output artifacts deterministically, without calling
an LLM. Replaces slow LLM-based validation with sub-second structural checks.

## When to Use

- After creating or editing a SKILL.md with MUST/NEVER/CHECKLIST rules
- To regenerate a stale `validator.py` after skill rules change
- To bootstrap validators for all skills at once (`compile-validators all`)

## When NOT to Use

- The skill has no MUST/NEVER/CHECKLIST rules — nothing to compile
- The validator already exists and rules haven't changed

ROLE Validator Compiler — reads SKILL.md rules and generates fast Python validator scripts
that check output artifacts deterministically, without calling an LLM.

READS
<skill-dir>/SKILL.md — the skill definition containing rules to compile

WRITES
<skill-dir>/validator.py — generated deterministic validator

REFERENCES
contracts/scripts/validator_lib.py — shared validation library (read for full API)
contracts/skill_grammar.md — MUST/NEVER/CHECKLIST DSL keywords

STEP 1: Determine scope
IF user names a specific skill (e.g. "compile-validators journeys") - Find the SKILL.md in the appropriate ai-assets/<domain>/skills/ directory - Compile only that skill
ELSE IF user says "all" or gives no argument - Find all SKILL.md files with MUST/NEVER/CHECKLIST rules under ai-assets/ - Compile each one

STEP 2: For each skill, read the SKILL.md

- Extract all MUST rules (lines starting with "MUST")
- Extract all NEVER rules (lines starting with "NEVER")
- Extract all CHECKLIST items ("- [ ] ...")
- Extract WRITES paths — these are the output directories to validate
- Extract OUTPUT templates — these define the expected file structure and fields
- Note any JSON Schema references (e.g. "validate against stories_schema.json")

STEP 3: Classify each rule
Determine whether each rule is **structural** (deterministically checkable)
or **semantic** (requires human/LLM judgment):

STRUCTURAL — generate Python check code: - File/directory existence: "X exists", "write X before Y" - JSON key presence: "include field X in Y.json" - JSON key values: "set status: draft", "exactly one hero" - JSON Schema validation: "validate against schema.json" - Frontmatter field presence: "include frontmatter: X, Y, Z" - Frontmatter field values: "set priority on all features" - Folder naming: "numbered group folders", "NN\_ prefix" - Cross-references: "every model maps to a feature", "trace to story" - Counting: "exactly one", "at least one per", "every X has Y" - Key casing: "no camelCase", "PascalCase models" - Boundary: "never write outside X/"

SEMANTIC — call v.skip() with reason: - Quality: "generic", "cookie-cutter", "rich", "memorable" - Relevance: "focus on custom business logic" - Process: "discuss with user first", "ask before writing" - Runtime: "builds without errors", "passes lint" - Subjective: "justified typography choices", "not just hex values"

STEP 4: Generate validator.py

**Determining sys.path depth:**
Skill validators live at different nesting depths within ai-assets/:

- Flat: `ai-assets/<domain>/skills/<skill>/validator.py` → 3 parents = `ai-assets/`
- Grouped: `ai-assets/<domain>/skills/<group>/<skill>/validator.py` → 4 parents = `ai-assets/`

Count the directory depth of the skill relative to `ai-assets/` and use the
corresponding number of parents: 3 for flat (`skills/<skill>/`), 4 for grouped
(`skills/<group>/<skill>/`).

Read skaileup/contracts/scripts/validator_lib.py to understand the full API.
Generate a Python script following this exact template:

OUTPUT <skill-dir>/validator.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Auto-generated validator for <skill-name>.
Re-generate with: /compile-validators <skill-name>
"""
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(**file**).resolve().parents[N] / "contracts" / "scripts"))
from validator_lib import Validator, main

    SKILL = "<skill-name>"

    def validate(cwd: str) -> dict:
        v = Validator(cwd, SKILL)

        # ── MUST rules ──
        <generated checks>

        # ── NEVER rules ──
        <generated checks>

        # ── CHECKLIST ──
        <generated checks>

        # ── Semantic (skipped) ──
        <v.skip() calls>

        return v.result()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main(validate)

STEP 5: Write checks using the validator_lib API

Common patterns (read validator_lib.py for the full API):

# File existence

v.must("shell.md exists", lambda: v.file_exists("\_concept/experience/screens/00_layout/shell.md"))

# Directory exists and has content

v.must("features written", lambda: v.dir_not_empty("\_concept/experience/features", "\*_/_.md"))

# JSON top-level keys

v.must("tokens.json has all sections",
lambda: v.json_field_exists("\_concept/discovery/brand/tokens.json",
"colors", "fonts", "radius", "mode", "shadows", "atmosphere", "tailwind"))

# JSON nested structure — use inline lambda with read_json

v.must("exactly one hero story map", lambda: (
v.json_count(
(v.read_json("\_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json") or {}).get("story_maps", []),
lambda m: m.get("stage") == "hero",
expected=1, op="eq"
)
))

# Every item in a JSON array has a field

v.must("every story has acceptance criteria", lambda: (
v.json_array_all_have_nonempty(
[s for m in (v.read_json("\_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json") or {}).get("story_maps", [])
for s in m.get("stories", [])],
"acceptance_criteria",
context="in stories.json"
)
))

# Frontmatter on all files matching a glob

v.must("all features have required frontmatter",
lambda: v.all_files_have_frontmatter(
"\_concept/experience/features/\*_/_.md",
"priority", "story_refs", "roles", "last_updated"))

# Folder naming pattern

v.must("numbered group folders",
lambda: v.folders*match_pattern(
"\_concept/experience/features",
r"^\d{2}*"))

# JSON Schema validation

v.checklist("stories.json validates against schema", lambda: (
v.json_schema_validate(
"\_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json",
"skaileup/contracts/stories_schema.json")
))

# Cross-reference: every key maps to existing files

v.checklist("every model maps to a feature",
lambda: v.every_key_maps_to_existing_file(
"\_concept/blueprint/datamodel/feature_map.json"))

# Semantic rules — skip

v.skip("produce generic brand output", rule_type="NEVER", reason="semantic — quality judgment")
v.skip("focus on custom business logic", rule_type="MUST", reason="semantic — content relevance")

STEP 6: Test the generated validator
RUN python3 <skill-dir>/validator.py --cwd <project-dir> --json

- Verify no import errors
- Verify the JSON output has the expected structure
- Fix any issues

STEP 7: Report

- Show a summary for each compiled skill:
  | Skill | Structural | Semantic (skipped) | Total |
  |-------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
  | <skill> | N checks | N skipped | N rules |
- If any rules were surprisingly hard to classify, mention them

MUST read validator_lib.py before generating any validator (for the full API)
MUST handle missing files gracefully — check existence before reading content
MUST mark all semantic/subjective rules with v.skip() and a clear reason
MUST use the correct sys.path depth (3 for flat skills, 4 for grouped skills)
MUST test each generated validator runs without errors
NEVER use external dependencies beyond Python stdlib + validator_lib
NEVER generate validators that call an LLM, subprocess, or network
NEVER hardcode absolute paths — all paths are relative to cwd
NEVER delete or overwrite an existing validator.py without reading it first

CHECKLIST

- [ ] validator_lib.py was read for the full API
- [ ] Every MUST/NEVER rule is either a structural check or explicitly skipped
- [ ] Every CHECKLIST item is either a structural check or explicitly skipped
- [ ] Correct sys.path depth used (count parents to ai-assets/)
- [ ] Generated validator runs without import or runtime errors
- [ ] Semantic rules have clear skip reasons
- [ ] No external dependencies used
