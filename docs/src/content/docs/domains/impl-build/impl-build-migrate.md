# Migrate — Database Migration Generator

## Overview

Reads the stack-independent data model (`model.dbml` + `model.json`) and
the chosen tech stack (`stack.md`), then generates database migration files
for the target ORM or migration framework. Translates semantic types to
stack-specific types using the translation table in
`contracts/semantic_types.md`.

## When to Use

- Data model is complete (`model.dbml` + `model.json` exist)
- Tech stack is chosen and includes a database + ORM/migration tool
- You need migration files before implementing features
- Setting up the database for the first time, or the model has changed

## When NOT to Use

- No data model yet — run `datamodel` first
- No tech stack yet — run `techstack` first
- You want seed data — use `seed` instead
- Schema-less database (MongoDB) with no migrations

## Prerequisites

**Hard gates:**

- `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.dbml`
- `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json`
- `_concept/blueprint/techstack.md`

---

ROLE Migration agent — generates stack-specific database migrations from model.json + model.dbml.

READS
\_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.dbml — human-readable model structure
\_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json — relationships, enums, field metadata
\_concept/blueprint/techstack.md — ORM + migration tool + database
contracts/semantic_types.md — type translation table

WRITES
<stack-specific migration files> — paths depend on ORM

MUST read semantic_types.md before generating — no semantic types in output
MUST cross-check model.dbml and model.json for consistency
MUST search for prog-expert-\* skills matching the ORM before generating
NEVER leave semantic type names in migration output
NEVER modify \_concept/ files

# ── Workflow ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 1: Read data model

- Read model.dbml (structure) and model.json (relationships, enums, metadata)
- If they disagree: model.dbml is authoritative for structure;
  model.json is authoritative for relationship and enum metadata
- Extract: entities, fields (name, type, constraints), relationships, enums

STEP 2: Read tech stack

- Read stack.md: database, ORM/migration tool, backend framework
- Determine migration target: Prisma, Drizzle, Directus, raw SQL, etc.

STEP 3: Load type translation table

- Read contracts/semantic_types.md
- Map every semantic type to the target stack's concrete type

STEP 4: Search for expert skills

- Search dev-implementation-experts-\* for stack-specific migration patterns
- Load relevant expert: prog-expert-prisma, prog-expert-drizzle, etc.
- Follow expert guidance for file structure, naming, idiomatic patterns

STEP 5: Generate migrations
For Prisma: generate `prisma/schema.prisma` then `prisma migrate dev --name init`
For Drizzle: generate schema files in `src/db/schema/` then `drizzle-kit generate`
For Directus: generate snapshot JSON or Directus API migration
For raw SQL: generate DDL migration file in `migrations/`

Apply these conventions always:

- IDs: UUID with auto-generation (per expert skill's UUID syntax)
- Timestamps: `created_at` on every entity; `updated_at` on most
- ON DELETE: read from model.json relationship `on_delete` field; default SET NULL
- Many-to-many: always generate junction table with two foreign keys
- snake_case column names, mapped from field names

STEP 6: Validate output

- Every entity in model.json has a corresponding table/model
- Every relationship is represented (foreign keys, junction tables)
- Every enum is defined
- No semantic types remain in the output
- UUIDs use auto-generation
- ON DELETE behavior matches model.json

STEP 7: Present summary

```
## Migration Summary
Target: <ORM> + <database>
Entities: N tables
Relationships: M (K foreign keys, J junction tables)
Enums: L
Files: <list>
```

EMIT [migrate] started run_id=<uuid>
EMIT [migrate] completed run_id=<uuid> tables=<N> enums=<M> files=<list>

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                            | What to do instead                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Semantic types in migration output | Always translate via semantic_types.md              |
| Missing junction tables            | Every m2m needs a junction table with two FKs       |
| Wrong ON DELETE                    | Check `on_delete` in model.json relationships       |
| Wrong UUID syntax                  | Use the expert skill for the correct syntax         |
| Missing timestamps                 | Every entity needs created_at; most need updated_at |
| Generating for wrong stack         | Always read stack.md first                          |

## Standalone Mode

**Gate check:** `model.dbml`, `model.json`, `stack.md`
**On completion:** Suggest running `seed` next.
