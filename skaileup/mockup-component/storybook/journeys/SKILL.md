# Storybook Journeys (Sub-skill 4/4)

ROLE Journey Builder — creates clickable multi-screen user flow stories (click-dummies)
that let users walk through complete journeys using real UI elements.

READS
\_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json — user journeys: story maps, personas, stages
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/pages/manifest.json — screen-to-page mapping (from pages sub-skill)
\_concept/experience/screens/\*_/_.md — screen specs (fallback for mapping)
[passed by orchestrator]: story_extension, package_manager

WRITES
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/stories/Journeys/Hero/<FlowName>.stories.<ext>
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/stories/Journeys/Vital/<FlowName>.stories.<ext>
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/stories/Journeys/Hygiene/<FlowName>.stories.<ext>

REQUIRES
state: \_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/pages/ has page components (sub-skill 3 completed)
state: \_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/components/AppShell exists (sub-skill 3 completed)
state: \_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/pages/manifest.json exists
state: \_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json exists

EMIT [storybook-journeys] started run_id=<uuid>

STEP 1: Map journeys to pages

- Read stories.json — collect ALL story maps where stage is hero, vital, OR hygiene
  (skip backlog stage)
- Count: hero=<N> (must be exactly 1), vital=<N>, hygiene=<N>
- Read src/pages/manifest.json for the screen-to-page mapping
- For each story map, resolve candidate_screens to page component imports:
  - Use manifest.json as primary source
  - Fall back to matching by route/purpose in screen specs if not in manifest
- Present the journey-to-page mapping:
  > "Journeys to build:
  >
  > - Hero: <name> (N steps → [page1, page2, ...])
  > - Vital: <name1> (N steps), <name2> (N steps)
  > - Hygiene: <name1> (N steps), ..."
  >   EMIT [storybook-journeys] checkpoint hero=1 vital=<N> hygiene=<N>

STEP 2: Build journey stories
For EACH story map (hero, vital, AND hygiene):

OUTPUT src/stories/Journeys/<Stage>/<JourneyName>.stories.<story_extension>

    title: 'Journeys/<Stage>/<JourneyLabel>'
    layout: 'fullscreen'

    ONLY import existing page components from src/pages/ and AppShell.
    The journey is a single Interactive story — a TRUE CLICK-DUMMY:

    Implementation pattern:
      - Render AppShell with sidebar, navigation at all times
      - Use framework-appropriate reactive state to track the current step (screen index)
      - Render the matching page component as AppShell content based on current step
      - Wire click/event handlers on REAL UI elements to advance steps:
          - Sidebar/top bar nav items → navigate to corresponding screen
          - Action buttons ("Submit", "Create", "Save") → advance to next step
          - Links and menu items → navigate to target screen
      - Highlight the active navigation item matching the current step
      - Show a subtle step indicator banner:
          persona name | Step N of M | step description
      - CLICK-HINT HIGHLIGHTING:
          When user interacts with an element that does NOT advance the step,
          apply .click-hint CSS class to all elements that DO advance.
          Auto-hide after 3 seconds.
          (Track showHints state + timeout, apply class to advancing elements)
      - Data should reflect journey progression:
          e.g., after "create project", next screen shows the new project in the list
      - Reuse types from src/@types/ — do NOT create new type files
      - Create per-step data objects inline in the story file

    For the hero flow: mark it as the default story when Storybook opens.

STEP 3: Verify
$ find \_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/stories/Journeys -name '_.stories._' | wc -l
→ Must equal total count of hero + vital + hygiene story maps

$ cd \_concept/experience/4_storybook && <package_manager> run build
IF build fails - Fix and retry

EMIT [storybook-journeys] completed run_id=<uuid> journeys=<N>

Expected sidebar structure:

```
Journeys/
├── Hero/
│   └── <HeroFlowName>          ← exactly 1 hero flow (default story)
├── Vital/
│   ├── <VitalFlow1>
│   └── <VitalFlow2>
└── Hygiene/
    ├── <HygieneFlow1>
    └── <HygieneFlow2>
```

MUST produce a journey story for EVERY non-backlog story map
MUST use ONLY existing page components and AppShell — no journey-specific components
MUST navigate through REAL UI elements — no "Next Step" / "Previous Step" buttons
MUST include click-hint highlighting (.click-hint class on elements that advance)
MUST show persona name and step indicator as a subtle banner
MUST render full AppShell with active navigation at all times
MUST mark hero flow as the default Storybook story
NEVER create journey-specific components, layouts, or wrappers
NEVER add explicit "Next Step" / "Previous Step" navigation
NEVER skip vital or hygiene flows — all non-backlog journeys are required

## Depth Behavior

| Depth    | Behavior                                                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `none`   | Skip this skill entirely                                           |
| `light`  | Minimal setup — hero flow stories only                             |
| `medium` | Standard setup — hero + vital flow stories (default)               |
| `max`    | Full setup — all flows, edge cases, responsive variants, dark mode |

CHECKLIST

- [ ] Navigation via real UI elements only — no prev/next buttons
- [ ] Click-hint highlighting implemented (.click-hint class)
- [ ] Persona + step indicator shown as subtle banner
- [ ] Hero flow is marked as default story
- [ ] Build passes
