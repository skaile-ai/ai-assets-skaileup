# Review — Structure Audit and Gardening

## Overview

The **review** skill is the Structure Auditor and Doc Gardener. It scans `_concept/`
for completeness, consistency, and entropy. It produces a health report with a quality
score (0–100) and can auto-fix safe issues in gardening mode.

**Two modes:**

- **Audit mode** (default): report issues, recommend fixes, ask before changing anything
- **Gardening mode** (`--garden`): auto-fix safe issues, report what was changed

## When to Use

- Check overall health of the concept
- Cross-references may be broken between features and screens
- Files may be stale or orphaned
- Want a quality score before proceeding to the next pipeline step
- User says "audit the concept", "check for issues", "cleanup", "gardening mode"
- After each skill completes — quick pass to catch drift
- Before `e2e` — ensure structure is clean before testing
- Before merging concept changes — gate on quality score

## When NOT to Use

- Auditing source code — use the `audit` quality skill instead
- Checking readiness for E2E — use the `ready` quality skill
- Running the full pipeline — use the `concept-orchestrator`

## Prerequisites

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** Read `contracts/concept_structure.md`,
`contracts/frontmatter.md`, `contracts/feedback_loop.md`,
and `contracts/golden_principles.md` before running any checks.

**Hard gate:** None — review can run anytime `_concept/` exists.

## Context Budget

| Action           | Path                                            | Required              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Must read        | `_concept/**/*.md`                              | Yes                   |
| Must read        | `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json`       | If exists             |
| Must read        | `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/feature_map.json` | If exists             |
| Check if present | `_concept/quality.json`                         | No (previous score)   |
| Check if present | `PLANS.md`                                      | No (plan drift check) |
| Never load       | Source code                                     | —                     |

## Standalone Mode

**Gate check:** None.
**On completion:** Present report and suggest next steps (`sync` for cross-ref repair, `ready` for readiness gate, or proceed if score ≥ 70).

ROLE Structure Auditor and Doc Gardener — scans \_concept/ for completeness, consistency, and entropy.

READS
\_concept/\*_/_.md — all concept documents
? \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json — data model (canonical cross-ref)
? \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/feature_map.json — model-to-feature mapping
? \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/seed.json — seed data (format checks)
? \_concept/quality.json — previous quality score
? PLANS.md — concept progress plan

WRITES
\_concept/quality.json — quality score + issue breakdown

REFERENCES
contracts/concept_structure.md — expected phase-grouped paths and folders
contracts/frontmatter.md — required YAML fields per file type
contracts/feedback_loop.md — cross-reference rules
contracts/golden_principles.md — mechanical rules to enforce
contracts/docs/OBSERVABILITY.md — audit event format
references/checks.md — detailed check tables and severity rules
references/gardening.md — safe vs unsafe auto-fix rules
references/report_templates.md — output templates for audit and gardening reports

MUST read all contracts/ contracts before any checks
MUST classify every issue by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
MUST write \_concept/quality.json after every run (audit or gardening)
MUST emit started and completed events with run_id for correlation
NEVER auto-fix unsafe issues in gardening mode (see references/gardening.md)
NEVER delete files — only remove broken references from frontmatter arrays
NEVER modify model.json or model.dbml directly (changes data model semantics)

EMIT [review] started mode=<audit|gardening> run_id=<uuid>

# ── Mode Selection ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

IF user says "review", "audit", or "check"

- Run audit mode (STEP 1–9)
  IF user says "garden", "cleanup", "tidy", or "fix entropy"
- Run gardening mode (STEP 10–14)

# ── Audit Mode (default) ─────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 1: Scan pipeline structure

- Use contracts/concept_structure.md for expected phase-grouped paths
- For each expected folder, check:
  - Folder exists in \_concept/
  - Has at least one expected output file
  - All .md files have valid frontmatter
    See references/checks.md for the full check table

STEP 2: Check frontmatter compliance

- For every .md file in \_concept/, verify against contracts/frontmatter.md:
  - Has YAML frontmatter delimiters (`---`)
  - `last_updated` field exists and is a valid ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - NO `status` field (globally removed — flag as issue if present)
  - Feature files: `priority`, `story_refs`, `roles`, `screens`, `data_entities` present
  - Screen files: `implements`, `data_entities`, `layout` present
  - Architecture: `apps`, `custom_modules`, `protocols`, `external_integrations` present
  - Stack: `platform`, `frontend`, `backend`, `database`, `tech_stack_skill` present

STEP 3: Check golden principles

- For every applicable rule in contracts/golden_principles.md:
  - Entity IDs: `snake_case`
  - Field names: `snake_case`
  - Enum values: `PascalCase`
  - Relation fields: `_id` suffix
  - Feature groups: sequential, no gaps
  - Screen groups mirror feature group numbers
  - Every feature has at least one requirement
  - All paths in frontmatter resolve to existing files
    See references/checks.md for the complete check table

STEP 4: Check cross-reference integrity

- For every feature with `screens:` entries:
  - Does each referenced screen file exist?
  - Does that screen's `implements:` list this feature?
- For every screen with `implements:` entries:
  - Does each referenced feature file exist?
  - Does that feature's `screens:` list this screen?
- If feature_map.json exists:
  - For each entity mapped, do the referenced feature files exist?
- If model.json exists:
  - For each entity, is there a corresponding entry in feature_map.json?

STEP 5: Check entropy indicators

- Files with `last_updated` > 30 days old → STALE
- Features with empty `screens: []` when screens folder exists → MISSING LINK
- model.json entities with no feature_map.json entry → ORPHANED ENTITY
- Files outside expected `_concept/` structure → UNEXPECTED FILE
- Feature groups without matching screen groups → GROUP MISMATCH
- PLANS.md progress out of sync with actual \_concept/ state → PLAN DRIFT
- Any file with `status:` field → STALE STATUS FIELD (globally removed)
  See references/checks.md for full entropy indicator table

STEP 6: Calculate quality score

- Structure completeness: steps present / steps required
- Frontmatter compliance: valid files / total files
- Golden principles: rules passing / rules checked
- Cross-reference integrity: valid links / total links
- Feature coverage: features with screens+data / total features
- Entropy: 100 - penalty per stale/orphan/mismatch
- Overall = weighted average of six categories

OUTPUT \_concept/quality.json
{
"timestamp": "<ISO-8601>",
"score": <0-100>,
"breakdown": {
"structure": <N>, "frontmatter": <N>, "golden_principles": <N>,
"cross_references": <N>, "coverage": <N>, "entropy": <N>
},
"issues": { "critical": <N>, "high": <N>, "medium": <N>, "low": <N> }
}

STEP 7: Present health report

- Render report using template in references/report_templates.md
- Include: quality score table, pipeline completeness, issues list, recommended actions
  EMIT [review] completed mode=audit run_id=<uuid> score=<N> issues=<N>

STEP 8: Offer fixes

> "Would you like me to fix any of these issues? I can repair cross-references,
> add missing frontmatter fields, and clean up stale entries."

# ── Gardening Mode (--garden) ───────────────────────────────────────

STEP 10: Run full audit silently (steps 1–6)

- Execute STEP 1 through STEP 6 to gather all issues
- Record score_before
  EMIT [review] started mode=gardening run_id=<uuid>

STEP 11: Apply safe auto-fixes

- For each issue classified as safe in references/gardening.md, apply fix immediately
- Emit an auto_fix event per change
  EMIT [review] auto_fix file=<path> action=<description> value=<new_value>

STEP 12: Recalculate quality score

- Re-run scoring (STEP 6) to get score_after

STEP 13: Present gardening report

- Render report using template in references/report_templates.md
- Include: auto-fixed list, needs-human-attention list, score_before → score_after

STEP 14: Emit completion
EMIT [review] completed mode=gardening run_id=<uuid> auto_fixes=<N> remaining=<N> score_before=<N> score_after=<N>

CHECKLIST

- [ ] All contracts/ read before checks
- [ ] quality.json written with all 6 breakdown fields
- [ ] Every issue classified by severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- [ ] Audit: offer to fix; Gardening: report every change made
- [ ] Score < 70 blocks new pipeline steps (flag to user)
- [ ] No files deleted — only broken references removed from arrays
- [ ] model.json/model.dbml not directly modified

## Depth Behavior

| Depth    | Behavior                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `none`   | Skip this skill entirely                                                             |
| `light`  | Quick scan — high-level issues only                                                  |
| `medium` | Standard review — all sections checked, fixes suggested (default)                    |
| `max`    | Deep audit — cross-reference validation, consistency checks, improvement suggestions |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                             | What to do instead                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Auto-fixing unsafe issues           | Only fix issues in references/gardening.md safe list. Report everything else.  |
| Running gardening without reporting | Always report every change made, even in gardening mode.                       |
| Checking status field               | `status` is globally removed — flag its presence as an issue, not its absence. |
| Ignoring \_grounding/ folder        | Check \_grounding/ for stale files and broken references too.                  |
| Modifying data model semantics      | Golden principle violations in model.json/model.dbml need human review.        |
| Checking postxl-schema.json         | Use model.json + feature_map.json as canonical data model targets.             |

## Integration

- **Called by:** `concept-orchestrator` or standalone (after each phase, before `e2e`)
- **Reads:** `_concept/` (all), `contracts/` (all)
- **Writes:** `_concept/quality.json`; auto-fixes in gardening mode
- **Feeds into:** quality gate for proceeding to next pipeline step

## Recurring Usage

Gardening mode is designed to run frequently:

- **After each skill completes** — quick pass to catch drift
- **Before `e2e`** — ensure structure is clean before testing
- **Before merging concept changes** — gate on quality score ≥ 70
