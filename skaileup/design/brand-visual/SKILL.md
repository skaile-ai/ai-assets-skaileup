# Brand Visual Identity

## Overview

The **brand-visual** skill defines a distinctive visual identity for the app through
plain-language discovery questions. It extracts palettes from reference URLs, proposes
a complete brand, and upon approval writes the artifacts that every downstream skill
consumes: screen specs, mockups, and implementation setup all read `tokens.json`.

The `tailwind` section in tokens.json provides CSS custom properties that map directly
to any CSS/Tailwind-based theming system — downstream skills use these without
re-inventing color names.

## When to Use

- Project brief is approved but `_concept/discovery/brand/` is empty or incomplete
- User says "brand", "colors", "fonts", "visual identity", "design tokens", "make it look good"
- User wants to change or re-evaluate the visual brand

## When NOT to Use

- Project brief has not been written or approved yet — run `overview` first
- User wants to define brand voice/copy — use `brand-behavioral`
- User wants to tweak existing tokens — edit the file directly

## Prerequisites

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** Read `contracts/concept_structure.md` and
`contracts/frontmatter.md` before proceeding.

**Hard gate:** `_concept/discovery/brief.md` must exist.

If the gate fails, stop:

> "No project brief found. Run `overview` first."

## Context Budget

| Action           | Path                                                | Required                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Must read        | `_concept/discovery/brief.md`                       | Yes                       |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/research/design_inspiration.md` | No (visual references)    |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/research/colors_fonts.md`       | No (palette research)     |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/brand-visual/user_input.json`  | No (pre-collected inputs) |
| Never load       | `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/`                     | —                         |
| Never load       | Source code                                         | —                         |

## Standalone Mode

**Gate check:** `_concept/discovery/brief.md` must exist.
**On completion:** Present summary and suggest next steps (screens, mock, brand-behavioral).

ROLE Brand Identity Designer — discovers aesthetic direction through questions,
extracts from reference URLs, proposes brand identity, and writes
`_concept/discovery/brand/` artifacts upon approval.

READS
\_concept/discovery/brief.md — app name, audience, problem, comparables
? \_concept/\_grounding/research/design_inspiration.md — color approaches, typography trends
? \_concept/\_grounding/research/colors_fonts.md — palette and typography research findings
? \_concept/\_grounding/brand-visual/user_input.json — pre-collected user inputs

WRITES
\_concept/discovery/brand/identity.md — full brand guide (aesthetic, colors, typography, atmosphere)
\_concept/discovery/brand/tokens.json — machine-readable design tokens + CSS custom properties
\_concept/discovery/brand/brandbook.html — self-contained visual brand reference (open in browser)
\_concept/discovery/brand/references/ — screenshots from user-provided reference URLs

REFERENCES
contracts/concept_structure.md — valid \_concept/ paths
contracts/frontmatter.md — brand frontmatter fields
references/design_philosophy.md — aesthetic principles, boldness guidelines
references/discovery_questions.md — interview questions and presentation templates
references/tokens_schema.md — tokens.json structure and output templates

REQUIRES
soft: browser (reference URL extraction deferred without it)

MUST produce a brand that is visually distinct and intentionally crafted for this specific app
MUST include all fields downstream skills expect in tokens.json (see references/tokens_schema.md)
MUST include tailwind section with CSS custom properties in tokens.json
MUST include brandbook.html — self-contained visual reference
MUST justify typography choices for the aesthetic direction
MUST define color usage rules — not just hex values but when to use each
MUST state the "memorable element" — what makes this app unforgettable visually
NEVER produce generic brand output (primary blue, gray secondary, Inter font)
NEVER write tokens.json without discussing aesthetic direction first
NEVER ignore reference URLs — always extract and analyze when provided
NEVER produce cookie-cutter brand that could belong to any app

EMIT [brand-visual] started run_id=<uuid>

STEP 1: Read context

- Read brief.md for app name, audience, problem, comparables
  IF \_grounding/research/design_inspiration.md exists
  - Read for color approaches, typography trends, visual references
    IF \_grounding/research/colors_fonts.md exists
  - Read for palette and typography research findings
    IF \_grounding/brand-visual/user_input.json exists
  - Load pre-collected inputs, skip those questions in STEP 2

STEP 2: Discover aesthetic direction

- Ask questions ONE AT A TIME, building on each answer
- See references/discovery_questions.md for the six questions and presentation templates
- Q1: Reference URL Q2: Feeling/mood spectrum Q3: Calibration extremes
- Q4: Existing brand assets Q5: Light/dark/both Q6: Font preferences
  MUST present a rich mood spectrum for Q2 — not a simple dropdown
  MUST present two opposing examples for Q3, relevant to the app type
- Skip questions already answered in user_input.json

STEP 3: Extract from reference URLs
IF user provides a URL - Open URL with browser tool and take screenshot - Save screenshot to \_concept/discovery/brand/references/ - Analyze: dominant colors, typography, layout density, elevation, border radius, mood - Present findings using the URL extraction template (see references/discovery_questions.md) - Ask: use as-is, adapt, or go in a different direction?
EMIT [brand-visual] checkpoint phase=aesthetic_direction mood=<mood> reference_urls=<N>

STEP 4: Compose brand proposal

- Synthesize all input into a complete brand proposal
- Present using the Brand Proposal Presentation Template (see references/discovery_questions.md):
  > "Here's the brand identity I'm proposing for [App Name]:
  > [aesthetic, colors with purpose, typography with rationale, details, memorable element]
  > Approve this, or tell me what to change?"
  > MUST include a stated "memorable element" — what makes this app unforgettable visually
  > MUST justify typography choices for the aesthetic direction
  > MUST define color usage rules — not just hex values but when to use each
  > EMIT [brand-visual] checkpoint phase=brand_composed colors=<N> fonts=heading=<H>,body=<B>

CHECKPOINT brand_approved
UNTIL user explicitly approves - Accept changes, re-present updated proposal - On approval: proceed to STEP 5

STEP 5: Write artifacts
$ mkdir -p \_concept/discovery/brand/references

OUTPUT \_concept/discovery/brand/identity.md
---
mood: "<aesthetic-description>"
mode: <light|dark|both>
last_updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---
<brand guide: aesthetic direction + reasoning, color usage rules, typography hierarchy,
spacing system, elevation, atmosphere, tone of voice for UI text, memorable element, do's/don'ts>

OUTPUT \_concept/discovery/brand/tokens.json
See references/tokens_schema.md for the complete required structure.
Required top-level keys: colors, fonts, radius, mode, spacing_base, shadows, atmosphere, tailwind
Required color keys: primary, secondary, accent, background, surface, text, text_muted, border, error, success, warning
Required tailwind keys: --color-primary, --color-primary-foreground, --color-secondary,
--color-background, --color-surface, --color-foreground, --color-muted, --color-border,
--color-destructive, --color-success, --color-warning, --radius

OUTPUT \_concept/discovery/brand/brandbook.html
Self-contained HTML (no external JS frameworks, Google Fonts links allowed).
Must include: hero section, color palette swatches, typography showcase, spacing/radius
examples, elevation/shadows, atmosphere demonstration, component previews (buttons, card,
input, nav), do's and don'ts. The brandbook uses its own brand tokens — it IS the brand.
Total file size under 50KB. Responsive. Print-friendly.

EMIT [brand-visual] checkpoint phase=artifacts_written artifacts=identity.md,tokens.json,brandbook.html

STEP 6: Present summary and hand off

> "Brand identity written to `_concept/discovery/brand/`:
>
> - **identity.md** — full brand guide ([aesthetic summary])
> - **tokens.json** — design tokens ([N] colors, fonts: [heading]/[body])
> - **brandbook.html** — visual brand reference (open in browser)
> - **references/** — [N] screenshots
>
> **Key decisions:** [1-2 line summary of the distinctive choices]
>
> To adjust: tell me what to change and I'll update the files.
>
> Next steps:
>
> - Run `screens` to spec UI screens (now colors and fonts are defined)
> - Run `brand-behavioral` to define tone of voice and copy guidelines
> - Run `concept-orchestrator` to continue the full pipeline"

## Design Philosophy

**Before producing any output, commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction.**
See `references/design_philosophy.md` for full guidelines.

**FORBIDDEN:** Generic palettes (primary blue, gray secondary, Inter font).
Every brand must be visually distinct and intentionally crafted for this specific app.

## Depth Behavior

| Depth    | Behavior                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`   | Skip this skill entirely                                                  |
| `light`  | Produce minimal output — key points only, no elaboration                  |
| `medium` | Standard output — balanced detail and coverage (default)                  |
| `max`    | Comprehensive output — exhaustive analysis, extended examples, edge cases |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                                | What to do instead                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generic blue primary + gray secondary + Inter font     | FORBIDDEN. Every brand must be visually distinct and crafted for this specific app.                            |
| Writing tokens.json without discussing direction first | Always present the brand proposal and get approval before writing files.                                       |
| Skipping brandbook.html                                | Required output — fastest way for stakeholders to evaluate the brand.                                          |
| Using a CDN framework in brandbook.html                | Must be self-contained. Only Google Fonts links allowed. Inline all CSS.                                       |
| Ignoring reference URLs                                | Always extract and analyze when provided — this is the user's taste anchor.                                    |
| Missing atmosphere or shadows in tokens.json           | Downstream skills fall back to bland defaults without these fields. Include all required fields.               |
| Writing a data dump instead of a visual brandbook      | The brandbook must demonstrate the brand — live component previews, actual colors rendered, typography in use. |

## Integration

- **Called by:** `concept-orchestrator` or standalone (parallel track after overview)
- **Requires:** `_concept/discovery/brief.md`
- **Feeds into:** `screens`, `mock`, `brand-behavioral` — all read tokens.json
