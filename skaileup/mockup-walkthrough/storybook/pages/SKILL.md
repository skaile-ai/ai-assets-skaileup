# Storybook Pages (Sub-skill 3/4)

ROLE Page Builder — creates full-page screen compositions from screen specs, including AppShell.

READS
\_concept/experience/screens/\*_/_.md — screen specs (purpose, route, UI elements, states, data)
\_concept/experience/screens/00_layout/shell.md — app shell structure, navigation, breakpoints
\_concept/discovery/brand/tokens.json — brand tokens
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/components/ — custom components from sub-skill 2
[passed by orchestrator]: component_library, story_extension, package_manager

WRITES
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/components/AppShell.<ext> — shared app shell wrapper
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/pages/<Group>/<PageName>.<ext> — page compositions
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/stories/Pages/<NN Group>/<Page>.stories.<ext>
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/@types/<entity>.<ts|js> — minimal interfaces for page data
\_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/pages/manifest.json — screen-to-page mapping for journeys

REQUIRES
state: \_concept/experience/4_storybook/ exists with passing build
state: \_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/components/ has barrel export (from sub-skill 2)
state: \_concept/experience/screens/ has screen specs
provided: component_library, story_extension, package_manager (from orchestrator)

EMIT [storybook-pages] started run_id=<uuid> screens=<N>

STEP 1: Read all screen specs

- Read 00_layout/shell.md for navigation structure, sidebar items, header, footer, breakpoints
- Read ALL screen specs in \_concept/experience/screens/\*_/_.md (excluding 00_layout/)
- Build complete inventory:
  | Group | Screen | Route | UI Elements | States | Data Requirements |

STEP 2: Build AppShell component
OUTPUT \_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/components/AppShell.<ext> - Render full app shell from shell.md: sidebar, header/top bar, content area - Navigation items derived from shell spec — never hardcoded - Accept children prop/slot for page content area - Support collapsed/expanded sidebar states - Responsive: mobile overlay, desktop fixed sidebar (use breakpoints from shell.md) - Use component_library components for shell elements (sidebar, avatar, nav, button, etc.) - Apply brand tokens throughout

STEP 3: Build AppShell story
OUTPUT \_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/stories/Pages/00 Layout/AppShell.stories.<ext> - title: 'Pages/00 Layout/AppShell' - layout: 'fullscreen' - Variants: DesktopExpanded, DesktopCollapsed, Mobile (at minimum)

STEP 4: Add types for pages

- For each page, identify data entities from screen spec Data Requirements
- Add MINIMAL interfaces to src/@types/<entity>.<ts|js>
  - Only include properties the page renders
  - Reuse + extend types from sub-skill 2 — don't duplicate
  - Add comment: `// Minimal type for Storybook`
  - Re-export from src/@types/index barrel
- Create inline seed data in story files:
  - Realistic domain-appropriate values from screen spec
  - Never use "Lorem ipsum"

STEP 5: Build page components
For EACH screen spec (excluding 00_layout/): - Derive numbered group prefix from folder name (e.g., 01_user_auth → "01") - Derive human-readable group name (e.g., 01_user_auth → "User Auth")

    a) OUTPUT src/pages/<Group>/<PageName>.<story_extension>
      - Import types from src/@types/
      - Import library components directly from component_library
      - Import custom components from src/components/index barrel
      - Compose all UI elements from screen spec
      - Apply layout constraints from screen spec (max-width, scroll, fixed elements)
      - Wire data via props (typed with src/@types/ interfaces)
      - Handle interactive states with framework-appropriate state management
      - Apply responsive breakpoints

    b) OUTPUT src/stories/Pages/<NN Group>/<PageName>.stories.<story_extension>
      - title: 'Pages/<NN> <GroupName>/<PageName>'
      - layout: 'fullscreen'
      - For EACH state listed in screen spec:
        - Create named story variant: Default, Populated, Empty, Loading, Error, etc.
        - Use appropriate seed data scenario
      - Add responsive variants: Mobile, Tablet

STEP 6: Write manifest and verify
OUTPUT \_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/pages/manifest.json
{
"<screen-spec-relative-path>": {
"component": "<Group>/<PageName>",
"import": "./src/pages/<Group>/<PageName>",
"route": "<route from screen spec>"
}
}

$ find \_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/stories/Pages -name '_.stories._' | wc -l
→ Should cover every screen spec + AppShell

$ cd \_concept/experience/4_storybook && <package_manager> run build
IF build fails - Fix and retry

EMIT [storybook-pages] completed run_id=<uuid> pages=<N>

MUST build AppShell first — pages render inside it
MUST import library components directly from component_library — not via wrappers
MUST import custom components from src/components/index barrel
MUST use icon_library for all icons
MUST create state variants for every state listed in screen specs
MUST include responsive variants (Mobile, Tablet) for each page
MUST use realistic domain-appropriate data — never "Lorem ipsum"
MUST write src/pages/manifest.json — required by storybook-journeys
NEVER hardcode navigation items — derive from shell spec
NEVER skip screen states documented in screen specs
NEVER invent colors or fonts — use CSS custom properties

## Depth Behavior

| Depth    | Behavior                                                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `none`   | Skip this skill entirely                                           |
| `light`  | Minimal setup — hero flow stories only                             |
| `medium` | Standard setup — hero + vital flow stories (default)               |
| `max`    | Full setup — all flows, edge cases, responsive variants, dark mode |
