# Scaffold — Project Scaffolding

## Overview

Creates a buildable project from a completed `_concept/` pipeline. Reads the
tech stack definition from `stack.md` to determine framework, CLI commands, and
project structure conventions. Delegates stack-specific scaffold steps to
`impl-architecture/templates/<tech_stack_skill>/TEMPLATE.md`.

**Framework-agnostic:** all stack-specific scaffold commands come from the
tech stack profile, not from this skill directly.

## When to Use

- Tech stack is chosen (`stack.md` exists) and the project directory does not yet exist
- User says "scaffold", "bootstrap", "create the project", "set up the repo"
- The `implement` orchestrator dispatches this as the first phase

## When NOT to Use

- No tech stack chosen — run `techstack` first
- Project already exists and needs code changes — use `implement-feature`
- Only need mockups — use `mock` (storybook)

## Prerequisites

**Hard gates:**

1. `_concept/blueprint/techstack.md` exists
2. `_concept/discovery/brief.md` exists (app name + slug)
3. `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json` exists (entities for initial setup)

**Required background:** Read `contracts/iron_laws.md` before starting.

## Context Budget

| Action         | Path                                                      | Required                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Must read      | `_concept/blueprint/techstack.md`                         | Yes                          |
| Must read      | `impl-architecture/templates/<tech_stack_skill>/TEMPLATE.md` | Yes (resolved from stack.md) |
| Must read      | `_concept/discovery/brief.md`                             | Yes                          |
| Must read      | `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json`                 | Yes                          |
| Read if exists | `_concept/blueprint/architecture.md`                      | Recommended                  |
| Read if exists | `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/seed.json`                  | Recommended                  |

ROLE Scaffold agent — creates a buildable project from concept artifacts using the tech stack profile.

READS
\_concept/blueprint/techstack.md — tech stack choice + tech_stack_skill field
impl-architecture/templates/<tech_stack_skill>/TEMPLATE.md — scaffold commands + project structure
\_concept/discovery/brief.md — app name, slug
\_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json — entity count, relationships
? \_concept/blueprint/architecture.md — custom modules, processes
? \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/seed.json — seed data for initial setup

WRITES
<app-slug>/ — project directory (stack-specific structure)
\_implementation/PLANS.md — initialized from concept features
\_implementation/progress.json — all features in pending status
\_implementation/decisions.md — empty decision log with header

REFERENCES
contracts/concept_structure.md — canonical \_concept/ paths
contracts/plans.md — PLANS.md format
contracts/seed_data.md — seed scenario format

MUST read tech stack profile before any scaffold commands
MUST run Level 1 verification (build) before any commit
MUST initialize \_implementation/ tracking structure
MUST create git branch: implement/<app-slug>
MUST confirm with user before creating the project directory
NEVER commit code that does not build
NEVER modify \_concept/ files

# ── Workflow ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 1: Read concept context

- Read brief.md: app name, slug, elevator pitch
- Read stack.md: extract tech_stack_skill value
- Read profile: `impl-architecture/templates/<tech_stack_skill>/TEMPLATE.md`
  Extract from profile:
  - `scaffold_command` — CLI command to create the project
  - `project_structure` — expected directory layout
  - `build_command` — how to verify build
  - `package_manager` — bun/pnpm/npm/uv/etc.
  - `env_setup_command` — how to copy .env files (if applicable)
- Read model.json: entity count for summary
  IF architecture.md exists
  - Extract custom_modules[], apps[], external_integrations[]

STEP 2: Confirm with user

- Present summary: app name, slug, tech stack, entity count, git branch name
  CHECKPOINT scaffold_confirm
  > "Ready to set up '<app-name>' using <tech-stack>.
  >
  > Technical details (if interested):
  > Stack: <tech_stack_skill>, Entities: N, Branch: implement/<app-slug>
  >
  > Proceed with setup?"

STEP 3: Create project

- Run the scaffold_command from the tech stack profile
  IF inside an existing git repository
  - Pass any `--skip-git` or equivalent flag from profile
- Install dependencies using package_manager

STEP 4: Install architecture dependencies (if applicable)
IF architecture.md exists AND custom_modules or external_integrations present - Install required npm/pip packages per the profile's dependency mapping - Add any necessary configuration (TypeScript paths, module aliases, etc.) - This step is additive only — module code is created by `infrastructure` skill later

STEP 5: Environment setup
IF env_setup_command exists in profile - Run it to copy .env.example → .env files
ELSE - Check if .env.example exists and copy manually if needed

STEP 6: Database migration (if applicable)
IF stack includes a relational database AND migration tool - Run initial migration from model.json/model.dbml - IF docker is available: start database container first - ELSE: warn that migration is deferred, app will run without data

STEP 7: Seed data (initial setup)
IF seed.json exists AND stack profile has seed setup instructions - Configure the `populated` scenario from seed.json - Write to the stack-appropriate seed file location

STEP 8: Verify build

- Run build_command from profile
- Run lint (from profile lint_command if defined)
- Run type check (from profile type_check_command if defined)
  UNTIL all checks pass

STEP 9: Initialize implementation tracking
IF git init needed (standalone project)
$ git init
$ git checkout -b implement/<app-slug>
ELSE
$ git checkout -b implement/<app-slug>

- Create \_implementation/PLANS.md (scope, source artifacts, phase checkboxes)
- Create \_implementation/progress.json (all must-have features in pending status)
- Create \_implementation/decisions.md (empty header)
  $ git add -A
  $ git commit -m "scaffold: initialize project from concept"

EMIT [scaffold] completed project=<app-slug> stack=<tech_stack_skill> build=passed branch=implement/<app-slug>

CHECKLIST

- [ ] Tech stack profile read — scaffold command, build command, package manager known
- [ ] User confirmed before creating project directory
- [ ] Project directory created with correct structure
- [ ] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Environment setup complete
- [ ] Database migrated (or deferred with docker warning)
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Git branch created: implement/<app-slug>
- [ ] \_implementation/ tracking initialized
- [ ] Initial commit created

## Standalone Mode

**Gate check:** `stack.md`, `brief.md`, `model.json`
**If gates fail:** Run `techstack`, `overview`, or `datamodel` as needed.
**On completion:** Suggest running `foundation` next.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                         | What to do instead                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hardcoding scaffold commands    | Read them from the tech stack profile                       |
| Skipping user confirmation      | Always confirm at STEP 2 before creating the directory      |
| Not running build verification  | Always verify build before committing                       |
| Missing \_implementation/ setup | Create PLANS.md + progress.json in same session as scaffold |
