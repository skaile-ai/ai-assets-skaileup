# Implement Supervised

## Overview

Executes the superpowers plan by dispatching one subagent per task. Each task gets a fresh
agent context with the full task text pasted verbatim — no file reading required.

After each task:

1. **Spec compliance review** — code is read against the feature spec line by line
2. **Code quality review** — only runs if spec compliance passes

The two-stage review is non-negotiable. Quality review on a misbuilt implementation is
wasted work. Spec compliance must always pass first.

**Status handling:** Every subagent reports one of four statuses. This skill handles each
according to the escalation paths in `contracts/subagent_dispatch.md`.

## When to Use

- `superpowers-plan.md` exists and has been approved
- `git-prepare` has been run (implementation branch exists)
- Ready to start or resume supervised implementation

ROLE Supervised implementation orchestrator — dispatches subagents per task, enforces two-stage review, handles 4-status reports.

READS
\_implementation/superpowers-plan.md — task list with verbatim specs
\_implementation/git-state.json — branch, git_mode, worktree path
\_concept/experience/features/**/\*.md — for spec compliance review reference
\_concept/experience/screens/**/\*.md — for spec compliance review reference

WRITES
\_implementation/superpowers-plan.md — task status updates
\_implementation/decisions.md — DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, BLOCKED logs
\_implementation/progress.json — feature status tracking

REFERENCES
contracts/subagent_dispatch.md — implementer prompt template, status handling
contracts/agent_patterns.md — Subagent Dispatch pattern

MUST read superpowers-plan.md before dispatching any task
MUST paste full task text verbatim into subagent prompt — never refer to plan file
MUST run spec-compliance review before code-quality review for every task
MUST log DONE_WITH_CONCERNS and BLOCKED statuses in decisions.md
MUST update task status in superpowers-plan.md after each task completes
NEVER dispatch multiple tasks to the same subagent (one task = one subagent)
NEVER skip spec-compliance review even if tests pass
NEVER advance to the next task while the current task status is BLOCKED
NEVER modify \_concept/ files

# ── Workflow ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 1: Read state

- Read superpowers-plan.md
- Read git-state.json (branch, git_mode, worktree_path)
- Read progress.json if exists (resume state)
- Determine start task: `start_from_task` input OR first pending task

STEP 2: Report start

> "Starting supervised implementation.
> Plan: N tasks, M pending, P complete.
> Starting from: Task <id> — <name>
> Git mode: <branch | worktree>"

# ── Task Loop ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FOR EACH task in superpowers-plan.md (in dependency order, starting from start task):
IF task.status = done OR skipped → continue to next task

STEP 3: Prepare dispatch context - Create feature branch (branch mode): `feat/<task-slug>`
$ git checkout implement/<app-slug>
$ git checkout -b feat/<task-slug> - OR: use worktree (worktree mode): subagent works inside .worktrees/<app-slug>/ - Build subagent prompt using template from contracts/subagent_dispatch.md: - Paste task.description verbatim - Paste task.relevant_specs verbatim - Paste task.tech_context verbatim - List task.expert_skills (if any) - Include task.acceptance_criteria

STEP 4: Dispatch subagent - Dispatch to fresh agent context at task.model_tier - Context: prompt only (no conversation history)
EMIT [implement-supervised] task_start task=<id> model=<tier>

STEP 5: Receive status - Parse STATUS block from subagent response - Handle per contracts/subagent_dispatch.md:

    CASE DONE → advance to STEP 6
    CASE DONE_WITH_CONCERNS
      - Log to _implementation/decisions.md:
        "[YYYY-MM-DD] Task <id> DONE_WITH_CONCERNS: <concerns>"
      - Advance to STEP 6
    CASE NEEDS_CONTEXT
      - Send question to user as standalone message
      - Wait for answer
      - Re-dispatch subagent with answer appended to prompt
      - Loop back to STEP 5
    CASE BLOCKED, route=context
      - Surface reason as standalone message to user
      - Wait for clarification
      - Re-dispatch with clarification appended
      - Loop back to STEP 5
    CASE BLOCKED, route=escalate-model
      - Log to decisions.md: "[YYYY-MM-DD] Task <id> escalated to higher model tier"
      - Re-dispatch at next tier (haiku → sonnet → opus)
      - Loop back to STEP 5
    CASE BLOCKED, route=decompose
      - Ask write-plan to decompose task <id> into sub-tasks
      - Insert sub-tasks into plan after current position
      - Update superpowers-plan.md
      - Resume loop from first sub-task

STEP 6: Spec compliance review - Read the feature spec(s) for this task from \_concept/experience/features/ - Read the code produced by the subagent - Check each requirement in the spec against the code — line by line - Assume the implementer "finished suspiciously quickly" — do not trust tests alone - Verify: every acceptance criterion is present in the code - Record: COMPLIANT | NON_COMPLIANT (with list of gaps)
EMIT [implement-supervised] spec_review task=<id> result=<COMPLIANT|NON_COMPLIANT> gaps=<N>

    IF NON_COMPLIANT
      - Fix gaps directly (or re-dispatch with gap list as additional context)
      - Re-run tests
      - Repeat STEP 6 until COMPLIANT

STEP 7: Code quality review (runs only after STEP 6 = COMPLIANT) - Check test coverage: all new code paths have at least one test - Check file boundaries: no bleeding between features - Check naming: follows golden_principles.md conventions - Check cleanliness: no console.log, TODO, commented-out blocks - Record: PASS | FAIL (with issue list)
EMIT [implement-supervised] quality_review task=<id> result=<PASS|FAIL> issues=<N>

    IF FAIL
      - Fix issues directly
      - Re-run tests
      - Repeat STEP 7 until PASS

STEP 8: Commit and merge
$ git add -p (review staged changes)
$ git commit -m "feat: <task-name>"
IF branch mode:
$ git checkout implement/<app-slug>
$ git merge --squash feat/<task-slug>
$ git commit -m "feat: implement <task-name>"
$ git branch -d feat/<task-slug>
IF worktree mode: - Merge from worktree back to implement/<app-slug>

STEP 9: Update plan and progress - Set task.status = done in superpowers-plan.md - Update progress.json
$ git add \_implementation/
$ git commit -m "chore: mark task <id> complete"
EMIT [implement-supervised] task_complete task=<id> spec=COMPLIANT quality=PASS

STEP 10: Run regression tests - Run full test suite to catch regressions introduced by this task
IF any pre-existing tests fail - Fix regressions before starting the next task - NEVER advance with a broken test baseline

IF complexity_tier = complex OR every N tasks (configurable, default 3)
CHECKPOINT progress_check > "Tasks complete: N/M > Last task: <name> > All tests: passing. > > Continue to the next task?"

END FOR

# ── Final ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 11: Final verification gate

- Run ALL tests one final time
- Run full build (backend + frontend + lint)
  EMIT [implement-supervised] completed tasks=<N> spec_reviews=<N> quality_reviews=<N>

STEP 12: Completion summary

> "All N tasks complete.
> Spec compliance: N/N passed.
> Code quality: N/N passed.
> Tests: all passing.
> Concerns logged: N (see \_implementation/decisions.md)
>
> Ready for finish-branch."

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                       | What to do instead                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dispatching multiple tasks to one subagent    | One task = one subagent. Always.                                        |
| Asking the subagent to read the plan          | Paste the task text verbatim. No file reading.                          |
| Running quality review before spec compliance | Spec compliance is the first gate. Always.                              |
| Advancing past a BLOCKED task                 | Never advance while a task is blocked — resolve first                   |
| Skipping regression tests after a task        | Run full test suite after every task. Not just the new ones.            |
| Setting all tasks to opus for safety          | Use the model tier from the plan — mechanical tasks on haiku saves cost |
