# Implement — Full App Implementation Orchestrator

## Overview

Drives a completed `_concept/` through scaffold, foundation, features, and
verification. Creates a structured implementation plan (dependency-ordered task
list), then executes it phase by phase with checkpoints at each milestone.

**Journey-first strategy:** features are built in user-journey order (hero →
vital → hygiene stages from `stories.json`), not feature-group-number order.
This delivers a working end-to-end flow early and reduces integration surprises.

**Complexity tiers** control checkpoint granularity:

- **small** — consolidated setup (scaffold + startup + foundation in one checkpoint)
- **standard** — scaffold+startup together, foundation separate
- **complex** — every phase has its own checkpoint

## When to Use

- All concept phases are complete (features, datamodel, screens, techstack)
- Ready to transition from concept design to code implementation
- Resuming an interrupted implementation session

## When NOT to Use

- Concept phases are incomplete — finish the pipeline first
- Adding a single feature to an already-built app — use `add-feature` + `implement-feature`
- Auditing existing code — use `audit`

## Prerequisites

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** Read `skaileup-shared/contracts/concept_structure.md`,
`skaileup-shared/contracts/plans.md`, `skaileup-shared/contracts/iron_laws.md`, and
`skaileup-shared/contracts/golden_principles.md` before starting.

**Hard gates (must exist):**

- `_concept/discovery/brief.md`
- `_concept/experience/features/` (at least one feature group)
- `_concept/blueprint/techstack.md`
- `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json`
- `_concept/experience/screens/` (at least one screen)
- `_concept/eval-concept.json` (concept must pass eval-concept — run skaileup-conceptualization orchestrator first)

# ── Phase 0: Initialize or Resume ─────────────────────────────────

STEP 1: Check for existing plan
IF \_implementation/PLANS.md exists - Read PLANS.md and progress.json - Identify last incomplete phase - Report status to user (see references/output_templates.md resume template) - Resume from that phase
ELSE - Continue to STEP 2

IF LEARNINGS.md does not exist - Create LEARNINGS.md with category headings: - **Skills & Subskills** — workflow gaps, confusing steps, missing procedures - **Tech Stack** — stack-specific surprises, profile gaps, ORM issues - **Generated Code** — quality issues, patterns that worked well - **Concept-to-Code** — spec gaps, translation issues - **Testing** — E2E patterns, seed data, TDD guard observations - **Other** — anything else noteworthy - Format: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] [<skill-name>] <learning>`

STEP 2: Read concept

- Read brief.md for app name, slug, complexity_tier (use user_input if not in brief)
- Read features/ to enumerate all must-have features and their story_refs
- Read model.json to build entity dependency graph
- Read screens/ for screen specs
  IF stories.json exists
  - Read journey order: hero → vital → hygiene (skip backlog)
  - Map each journey to its pages and features (via candidate_screens → screen specs → features.screens[])
    ELSE
  - Fall back to feature group numeric order
    IF architecture.md exists
  - Extract custom_modules[], apps[], external_integrations[], protocols[]

STEP 3: Search for expert skills

- Read stack.md → tech_stack_skill field
- Search dev-implementation-experts-\* for skills matching the stack
- Note available experts — referenced in individual task instructions

STEP 4: Build implementation plan

- Analyze model.json relationships → determine entity insert order (parents before children)
- Determine feature implementation order (journey-first if stories.json exists, else numeric)
- For each feature (in order): create task entry with file list, entities, screens, expert skills
- Prepend infrastructure tasks: migrations, seed, auth, brand/theme, app shell layout
  IF architecture.md has custom_modules beyond standard
  - Add infrastructure sub-phase (between foundation and features)
- Write \_implementation/PLANS.md (see skaileup-shared/contracts/plans.md format)
- Write \_implementation/progress.json with all features in pending status
- Write \_implementation/decisions.md with header
- Log decision: "Complexity tier: <tier> — controls checkpoint frequency and testing depth"

CHECKPOINT plan_approval

> "Here's the plan to build your app:
>
> 1. Set up the project structure and dependencies
> 2. Apply your brand, configure auth, create the app shell
>    [If infrastructure]: 3. Set up custom backend capabilities
> 3. Build each feature in journey order: [list journeys / feature groups]
> 4. You test the app against your requirements (UAT)
> 5. Final testing and verification
>
> Features: N must-have across M journeys/groups
> Expert skills available: [list]

> Approve the plan, or tell me what to modify."
> DO log_learnings

# ── Phase 1: Setup ────────────────────────────────────────────────

Setup phases are defined by the active flow YAML. Each node in the flow maps to
one sub-skill dispatch. For each phase node in order: RUN the mapped sub-skill,
verify it completes successfully, then emit a checkpoint before proceeding.

When invoked standalone (no named flow context), select the flow file by tier:
complexity_tier = small → flows/small.flow.yaml (scaffold+foundation consolidated)
complexity_tier = standard → flows/standard.flow.yaml (scaffold, foundation, optional infrastructure)
complexity_tier = complex → flows/complex.flow.yaml (scaffold, startup, foundation, infrastructure — all checkpointed)

Read the selected flow YAML, then execute its nodes in sequence:

- For each node with type "skill": RUN that sub-skill as a sub-agent
- For each node with optional=true: check the skip condition first; if condition is false,
  record the phase as skipped in progress.json and proceed to the next node
- After each node: verify the sub-skill output, update progress.json, emit checkpoint

EMIT [implement] infrastructure_complete modules=<N> processes=<M>

# ── Phase 2: Features (journey-first) ─────────────────────────────

STEP 6: Implement feature groups / journeys

- Process journeys in stage order: hero → vital → hygiene (if stories.json exists)
- OR process feature groups in numeric order (if no stories.json)
- For each journey/group:
  - Announce: name, page/feature list in business terms
  - RUN implement-feature sub-skill with journey context
    - Journey-first: implement-feature receives the full journey (pages + features)
    - Single-feature fallback: implement-feature can also receive one feature_id
  - On completion: page tests + all feature tests pass
  - Run ALL E2E tests to catch regressions
  - CALL eval_feature_gate(feature_group=<group-name>, app_url=<dev-server-url>)
  - DO update_progress
    EMIT [implement] feature_complete feature=<group>/<feature> tests=<count>

  CHECKPOINT feature_group

  > "Journey/group '<name>' is complete. Users can now:
  > [list what users can do in plain language]
  > All automated tests: passing.
  >
  > Approve to continue to the next journey/group."
  > DO log_learnings

  IF browser skill is available

  > "Would you like a quick preview of what we just built?"
  > IF user wants preview

      - Navigate to journey/group's primary screens
      - Show core user flows
      - Ask for feedback

STEP 7: Repeat for all journeys/groups
UNTIL all implemented

# ── Phase 3: User Acceptance Testing ──────────────────────────────

STEP 8: UAT

- Identify key user journeys from stories.json or feature hero flows
- For each journey, describe what to test in plain language:
  > "Try [action] and see if [expected result]."
- Walk through journeys using browser skill (navigate, screenshot, show user)
- Record: pass/fail, user comments
  OUTPUT \_implementation/uat-report.json
  { journeys: [...], overall: "pass|fail", iteration: 1 }

IF any journey fails or needs changes - Collect all feedback - Implement fixes (re-enter Phase 2 for affected features) - Re-run UAT for fixed journeys
UNTIL all journeys pass or user accepts remaining issues

DO update_progress

CHECKPOINT uat_approval > "You've tested all the key things your app should do: > [List journeys with pass/fail results] > > Approve to proceed to final verification, or identify additional issues."
DO log_learnings
EMIT [implement] uat_complete journeys=N passed=P failed=F

# ── Phase 4: Product Evaluation ────────────────────────────────────

STEP 9: Run eval-code (full scope) as a fresh sub-agent
DISPATCH eval-code, scope=full
READ \_implementation/eval-code.json after completion

IF eval-code verdict = "fail" - Show blocking_issues to user - Re-enter Phase 2 for affected features - Re-run eval-code after fixes

IF eval-code verdict = "warn" - Show medium findings to user - User decides which (if any) to address before continuing

STEP 10: Run eval-product as a fresh sub-agent
DISPATCH eval-product, app_url=<dev-server-url>
READ \_implementation/eval-product.json after completion

IF eval-product verdict = "approved" - Proceed to CHECKPOINT final_verification

IF eval-product verdict = "fail" - Show blocking issues (goals not achieved, performance blockers) to user - STOP — product requires rework; re-enter Phase 2 for affected features - Re-dispatch eval-product after iteration

IF eval-product verdict = "needs_iteration" - Show improvement_priorities to user (ranked) - User decides which to address - Re-enter Phase 2 for selected items - Re-dispatch eval-product after iteration

DO update_progress
EMIT [implement] completed run_id=<uuid> features=<count> e2e_tests=<count>

CHECKPOINT final_verification
Gate: eval-code verdict = pass (or warn with user acceptance) AND eval-product verdict = approved (or user explicitly accepts remaining priorities)
User sees: eval-code verdict + eval-product verdict + all improvement priorities
DO log_learnings

- On approval: present completion summary (see references/output_templates.md)
- Final commit: "chore: mark implementation complete in PLANS.md"

CHECKLIST

- [ ] PLANS.md created or resumed before any work
- [ ] Journey-first order followed (hero → vital → hygiene)
- [ ] PLANS.md updated at every checkpoint
- [ ] User approved: plan, foundation, each feature group, final verification
- [ ] \_concept/ files not modified
- [ ] LEARNINGS.md updated at checkpoints

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                             | What to do instead                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skipping the plan phase                             | Always create PLANS.md first — it defines the dependency order                   |
| Feature-group-number order instead of journey order | Use stories.json hero→vital→hygiene order when available                         |
| Running eval-code/eval-product before UAT           | UAT comes first — user confirms app works, then eval-code and eval-product gates |
| Not logging learnings                               | Append to LEARNINGS.md at every checkpoint — institutional knowledge             |
| Mixing feature code with progress-tracking commits  | One commit per feature, separate commit for progress updates                     |

## Integration

- **Reads:** entire `_concept/` pipeline
- **Writes:** `_implementation/` tracking, `LEARNINGS.md`
- **Dispatches to:** `scaffold`, `foundation`, `infrastructure`, `implement-feature`, `eval-feature`, `eval-product`, `eval-code`
- **Called by:** user directly or automated pipeline
