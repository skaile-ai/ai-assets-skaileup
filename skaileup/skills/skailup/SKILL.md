# Orchestrator — Full Concept Pipeline

## Overview

Drives a new project through the three conceptualization phases — Discovery,
Experience, Blueprint — producing a versioned `_concept/` artifact folder.
Creates a structured concept plan (PLANS.md), then executes it phase by phase
with checkpoints at each milestone.

**Complexity tiers** control checkpoint granularity:

- **small** — one checkpoint per phase (3 total)
- **standard** — checkpoint after each major sub-skill
- **complex** — checkpoint after every sub-skill including optional ones

## When to Use

- Starting a new project from scratch
- Resuming an interrupted concept session
- Running the full concept pipeline end-to-end

## When NOT to Use

- Reverse-engineering an existing codebase — use `reverse-engineer`
- Adding a feature to a completed concept — use `add-feature`
- Only need one specific skill (e.g., just the data model) — run it standalone

## Prerequisites

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** Read `skaileup-contracts/contracts/concept_structure.md`,
`skaileup-contracts/contracts/plans.md`, `skaileup-contracts/contracts/iron_laws.md`, and
`skaileup-contracts/contracts/agent_patterns.md` before starting.

**Hard gates:** None (this is the entry point).

## Context Budget

| Must read    | `skaileup-contracts/contracts/concept_structure.md` | Yes         |
| Must read    | `skaileup-contracts/contracts/plans.md`             | Yes         |
| Must read    | `skaileup-contracts/contracts/iron_laws.md`         | Yes         |

# -- Phase 0: Initialize or Resume ------------------------------------------

STEP 1: Check for existing plan
IF \_concept/PLANS.md exists - Read PLANS.md - Identify last incomplete phase - Report status to user - Resume from that phase
ELSE - Continue to STEP 2

IF LEARNINGS.md does not exist - Create LEARNINGS.md with category headings: - **Skills & Subskills** — workflow gaps, confusing steps - **Concept Quality** — spec gaps, ambiguities found - **User Communication** — what worked well in checkpoints - **Other** — anything else noteworthy - Format: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] [<skill-name>] <learning>`

STEP 2: Self-collect inputs

- Ask user for: project name, one-line description, target audience
- Ask for complexity_tier (or use default: standard)
- Write initial PLANS.md with phase structure

EMIT [orchestrator] plan_created phases=3

# -- Phase 1: Discovery -----------------------------------------------------

STEP 3: Project Overview

- RUN overview sub-skill → \_concept/discovery/
- Produces: brief.md, goals.md, comparable.md
- Read brief.md to extract complexity_tier for checkpoint control
- DO update_progress

IF complexity_tier is complex
CHECKPOINT overview > "Project brief is ready. Here's what I understood: > [summary from brief.md] > Approve to continue."

STEP 4: Research (optional, parallel-capable)

- Ask user if research is needed
  IF yes
  - RUN research sub-skill → \_concept/\_grounding/
  - DO update_progress
    ELSE
  - Skip research, log decision

STEP 5: Brand Identity

- RUN brand-visual sub-skill → \_concept/discovery/brand/
- Produces: identity.md, tokens.json
- DO update_progress

IF complexity_tier is complex
CHECKPOINT brand > "Brand identity defined: [summary]. > Approve to continue."

CHECKPOINT discovery_complete

> "Discovery phase complete:
>
> - Project brief: [name] — [one-liner]
> - Research: [done/skipped]
> - Brand: [color palette, typography summary]
>
> Approve to move to Experience design."
> DO log_learnings

EMIT [orchestrator] phase_complete phase=discovery

# -- Phase 2: Experience ----------------------------------------------------

STEP 6: User Journeys (optional)
IF stories/journeys are part of the flow - RUN journeys sub-skill → \_concept/experience/journeys/ - Produces: stories.json, journey maps - DO update_progress

STEP 7: Features

- RUN features sub-skill → \_concept/experience/features/
- Produces: feature group folders with feature specs
- DO update_progress

IF complexity_tier is complex
CHECKPOINT features > "Features specified: [count] features across [count] groups. > Key features: [list top 5] > Approve to continue."

STEP 8: Screens

- RUN screens sub-skill → \_concept/experience/screens/
- Produces: screen specs with cross-references to features
- DO update_progress

STEP 9: Storybook / Mockups (optional)
IF storybook/mockup is part of the flow - RUN storybook or mock sub-skill → \_concept/experience/4_storybook/ - DO update_progress

CHECKPOINT experience_complete

> "Experience phase complete:
>
> - Features: [count] across [count] groups
> - Screens: [count] screen specs
> - Journeys: [done/skipped]
> - Mockups: [done/skipped]
>
> Approve to move to Blueprint."
> DO log_learnings

EMIT [orchestrator] phase_complete phase=experience

# -- Phase 3: Blueprint ------------------------------------------------------

STEP 10: Tech Stack

- RUN techstack sub-skill → \_concept/blueprint/
- Produces: stack.md
- DO update_progress

IF complexity_tier is complex
CHECKPOINT techstack > "Tech stack selected: [summary]. > Approve to continue."

STEP 11: Architecture (optional)
IF project complexity warrants architecture design - RUN architecture sub-skill → \_concept/blueprint/ - Produces: architecture.md - DO update_progress

STEP 12: Data Model

- RUN datamodel sub-skill → \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/
- Produces: model.dbml, model.json, model.schema.json
- DO update_progress

# ── Phase 4: Concept Evaluation Gate ──────────────────────────────

STEP: Dispatch eval-concept as a fresh sub-agent (separate context — not this agent)

- Sub-agent reads: \_concept/ artifacts
- Sub-agent writes: \_concept/eval-concept.json
- WAIT for eval-concept to complete

READ \_concept/eval-concept.json after sub-agent finishes

IF verdict = "pass" - Update PLANS.md: mark eval-concept DONE - Report to user:
✓ Concept evaluation passed (overall: <score>/100)
Ready for skaileup-implementation.

IF verdict = "needs_resolution" - Display all blocking_flags with their resolutions to user - PAUSE: ask user to resolve each blocking flag - After user confirms fixes: re-dispatch eval-concept - Repeat until verdict = "pass" (or user explicitly overrides with reason)

IF verdict = "fail" - Display all flags - STOP — concept requires rework - Tell user which phase to re-run (add-feature or specific sub-skills)

CHECKPOINT eval_concept
Gate: CANNOT proceed to skaileup-implementation until eval-concept verdict = "pass"
IF verdict != "pass": STOP — do not display blueprint_complete message
User sees: eval-concept scores + verdict + any remaining flags

CHECKPOINT blueprint_complete

> "Blueprint phase complete:
>
> - Tech stack: [framework, database, UI library]
> - Architecture: [done/skipped]
> - Data model: [count] entities, [count] relations
>
> Your concept is ready for implementation.
> Next steps: run the implementation pipeline or review individual artifacts."
> DO log_learnings

# -- Procedures --------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURE log_learnings

- After each checkpoint, reflect on what happened
- Append to LEARNINGS.md under the most relevant category
- Only log genuine observations, not status updates

PROCEDURE update_progress

- Check off completed skill in PLANS.md
- Commit if in a git repo: "chore: update concept progress"

PROCEDURE auto_review

- Activated when user says "auto-review", "autonomous", or "run without stopping"
- Run lint_concept.py on \_concept/
- Run review skill in gardening mode
- Read quality score from \_concept/quality.json
- Score >= 70 and 0 blocking issues → auto-approve and continue
- Else → pause and escalate to user

CHECKLIST

- [ ] PLANS.md created or resumed before any work
- [ ] Phase order followed (Discovery → Experience → Blueprint)
- [ ] PLANS.md updated at every checkpoint
- [ ] User approved each phase boundary
- [ ] \_concept/ files not overwritten without approval
- [ ] LEARNINGS.md updated at checkpoints
- [ ] eval-concept dispatched as fresh sub-agent after Blueprint phase
- [ ] eval-concept verdict = "pass" before pipeline declared complete

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                    | What to do instead                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skipping the plan phase                    | Always create PLANS.md first                                     |
| Running datamodel before features          | Features define what entities are needed — always features first |
| Not checking for existing \_concept/       | Read PLANS.md if it exists — resume, don't restart               |
| Presenting raw file contents as checkpoint | Summarize in plain language, not markdown dumps                  |
| Running all skills without checkpoints     | User approval at phase boundaries is mandatory                   |

## Integration

- **Reads:** `skaileup-contracts/contracts/` for rules and structure
- **Writes:** `_concept/` pipeline artifacts, `LEARNINGS.md`
- **Dispatches to:** `overview`, `research`, `brand-visual`, `journeys`, `features`, `screens`, `storybook`, `techstack`, `architecture`, `datamodel`
- **Called by:** user directly, CLI flows, or automated pipeline
- **Hands off to:** Implementation orchestrator (skaileup-implementation)
