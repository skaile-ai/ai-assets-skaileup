# E2E — End-to-End Browser Testing

## Overview

The **e2e** skill runs end-to-end browser tests against a running application.
It reads screen specs, features, and data model from `_concept/`, uses the
**browser** skill to test every user journey, takes screenshots, and validates
database records.

## When to Use

- The app is running and the user wants end-to-end browser testing
- The user says "test the app", "E2E tests", "browser testing", "test the user journey"
- After implementation to verify features work as specified
- The orchestrator dispatches this after implementation is complete

## When NOT to Use

- The app is not running or cannot be started — fix that first
- No source code exists — nothing to test
- You want static code analysis only — use **audit** instead
- You want to check concept readiness — use **ready** instead

## Prerequisites

**Hard gates:**

1. Source code must exist (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, or equivalent)
2. App must be runnable (dev server can be started)

## Context Budget

| Action         | Path                                                | Required                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Must read**  | `_concept/discovery/brief.md`                       | Yes                         |
| **Must read**  | `_concept/experience/features/**/*.md`              | Yes                         |
| **Must read**  | `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json`           | Yes                         |
| **Must read**  | `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/seed.json`            | Yes                         |
| **Must read**  | `_concept/experience/screens/**/*.md`               | Yes                         |
| **Must read**  | `package.json` (or equivalent)                      | Yes                         |
| **Optional**   | `.env.example`                                      | No (auth and DB connection) |
| **Never load** | `_concept/_grounding/`, `_concept/discovery/brand/` | —                           |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                              | What to do instead                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Testing without starting the app     | Start the dev server first. E2E tests require a running app.       |
| Using hardcoded test data            | Use seed.json scenarios for all test data.                         |
| Not re-snapshotting after navigation | Always re-snapshot after page changes (element refs become stale). |
| Skipping responsive testing          | Test at mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.                   |
| Not cleaning up                      | Always stop the dev server and close browser sessions.             |

ROLE E2E Testing agent — runs browser tests against every user journey, captures screenshots, validates database state.

READS
\_concept/discovery/brief.md — app name, purpose
\_concept/experience/features/**/\*.md — feature specs, requirements, success criteria
\_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json — model definitions for DB validation
\_concept/experience/screens/**/\*.md — screen specs with routes, components, states
? \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/seed.json — scenario-based test data

WRITES
e2e-screenshots/\*_/_.png — per-journey step screenshots
? e2e-test-report.md — optional full markdown report

REFERENCES
contracts/seed_data.md — seed scenario format and data quality rules
contracts/feedback_loop.md — how to update feature last_updated after testing
references/report_template.md — report format, seed usage, responsive breakpoints, DB validation

REQUIRES
hard: agent-browser
soft: docker (database validation deferred without it)
state: \_concept/experience/screens/**/\*.md exist
state: \_concept/experience/features/**/\*.md exist

MUST run audit before this skill for static analysis
MUST use seed.json scenario data for all form inputs (never invent test data)
MUST screenshot every step to e2e-screenshots/<journey>/
MUST validate database records after data-modifying interactions
MUST update last_updated on feature files for every passing journey
NEVER skip responsive testing on key pages
NEVER leave dev server running after completion

EMIT [e2e] started run_id=<uuid>

STEP 1: Pre-flight checks

- $ uname -s
  IF output is not "Linux" or "Darwin"
  - Stop: "agent-browser only supports Linux, WSL, and macOS."
- Verify app has a browser-accessible frontend (package.json with dev script, pages/, or index.html)
  IF no frontend found
  - Stop: "No browser-accessible frontend detected."
- $ agent-browser --version || (npm install -g agent-browser && agent-browser install --with-deps)

STEP 2: Parallel research (two sub-agents)

- Sub-agent 1 — Concept & User Journeys:
  - Read \_concept/discovery/brief.md for app name, purpose
  - Read \_concept/experience/features/\*_/_.md for every feature, requirements, success criteria
  - Read \_concept/experience/screens/\*_/_.md for every screen: route, components, template data, states
  - Read package.json for dev server command, port, URL
  - Read .env.example or feature docs for auth info
  - Synthesize: startup guide (exact commands) + user journey list (steps, interactions, expected outcomes)
- Sub-agent 2 — Database Schema & Data Flows:
  - Read \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json for models, relationships, field types
  - Cross-reference .env.example for connection details
  - Return: DB type/connection, model-to-table mapping, data flows per user action, validation queries

STEP 3: Start application

- Install dependencies
- Start dev server in background
- Wait for server ready
- $ agent-browser open <url>
- Confirm page loads successfully
- $ agent-browser screenshot e2e-screenshots/00-initial-load.png

EMIT [e2e] checkpoint phase=app_started url=<url>

STEP 4: Test user journeys

- For each journey from Step 2 sub-agent 1:
  - Use agent-browser commands with seed data from \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/seed.json
    (see references/report_template.md for scenario mapping)
  - Screenshot every interaction step to e2e-screenshots/<journey>/
  - Analyze screenshots with Read tool
  - $ agent-browser console
  - Check for JS errors in console output
  - After data-modifying interactions, query DB to verify records match model.json definitions
    IF issue found - Document the issue - Attempt fix in source code - Re-test and screenshot the fix
    UNTIL all journeys tested

EMIT [e2e] checkpoint phase=journeys_tested tested=<N> passed=<N> failed=<N>

STEP 5: Responsive testing

- For each key page, test at three viewports: 375x812, 768x1024, 1440x900
- Screenshot each viewport to e2e-screenshots/responsive/

STEP 6: Cleanup

- Stop dev server
- Close browser session

STEP 7: Update feature tracking (feedback loop)

- For every successfully tested journey:
  - Find corresponding feature in \_concept/experience/features/
  - Update last_updated in frontmatter to today's date

EMIT [e2e] feedback_loop updated experience/features/<group>/<feature>.md updated last_updated

STEP 8: Report

- Present summary (see references/report_template.md for format)
- Optionally export to e2e-test-report.md
