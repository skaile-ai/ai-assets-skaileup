# Ready — Pre-flight Readiness Gate

## Overview

The **ready** skill is the Readiness Gate. It verifies that a feature or the
whole app is ready for implementation or end-to-end testing. It surfaces exactly
what is missing so the user can fix gaps efficiently.

## When to Use

- Checking if features are ready for implementation or E2E testing
- The user says "is it ready?", "pre-flight check", "readiness"
- Before running `e2e` to avoid wasting time on incomplete features
- The orchestrator dispatches this as a gate before E2E

## When NOT to Use

- You want to audit concept structure health — use **review** instead
- You want to audit source code — use **audit** instead
- No features exist yet — run **features** first

## Prerequisites

**Hard gate:** `_concept/experience/features/` must exist with at least one feature file.

## Context Budget

| Action         | Path                                            | Required                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Must read**  | `_concept/experience/features/**/*.md`          | Yes                           |
| **Must read**  | `_concept/experience/screens/**/*.md`           | Yes                           |
| **Must read**  | `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json`       | Yes                           |
| **Must read**  | `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/feature_map.json` | Yes                           |
| **Must read**  | `_concept/discovery/brand/tokens.json`          | Yes (existence check)         |
| **Must read**  | `_concept/blueprint/techstack.md`               | Yes (existence check)         |
| **Optional**   | `_concept/experience/4_storybook/`              | No (mockup/composition check) |
| **Never load** | Source code, `_concept/_grounding/`             | —                             |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                | What to do instead                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Checking only some features            | Check every feature in every group — never sample.          |
| Reporting "ready" when any check fails | A feature is "ready" only when ALL required checks pass.    |
| Not naming the specific skill to run   | Always name the exact skill that resolves each gap.         |
| Blocking on optional checks            | Storybook/mockup is a soft check. Do not block when absent. |
| Running fixes automatically            | Only report. Let the user decide what to fix and when.      |

ROLE Readiness Gate — verifies features are ready for E2E testing, surfaces gaps.

READS
\_concept/experience/features/**/\*.md — feature list and frontmatter
\_concept/experience/screens/**/\*.md — screen specs (implements: field)
\_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json — model definitions
\_concept/blueprint/datamodel/feature_map.json — model-to-feature mapping
\_concept/discovery/brand/tokens.json — brand tokens existence
\_concept/blueprint/techstack.md — tech stack existence
? \_concept/experience/4_storybook/ — storybook compositions (soft check)

WRITES
(none — read-only audit skill, output is the report shown to user)

REFERENCES
contracts/concept_structure.md — expected \_concept/ paths
references/report_templates.md — readiness table, fix templates, check details

STEP 1: Discover features

- Read all files in \_concept/experience/features/\*_/_.md
- Build feature list from discovered files (feature name + group)
  IF no feature files found
  - Stop with: "No features found in `_concept/experience/features/`. Run `features` first."

STEP 2: Check global prerequisites

- Verify \_concept/discovery/brand/tokens.json exists
- Verify \_concept/blueprint/techstack.md exists
- Record global status (brand tokens ✓/✗, tech stack ✓/✗)

STEP 3: Check each feature
For each feature, verify all of:

- Concept doc exists: \_concept/experience/features/<group>/<feature>.md
- Screen spec: at least one .md in \_concept/experience/screens/ has this feature in `implements:`
- Data model: feature listed in feature_map.json for at least one model
- Mockup/composition: soft check — storybook page at \_concept/experience/4_storybook/src/pages/ OR html file in \_concept/05_mockups/ (either counts; absence is a warning, not a blocker)
  A feature is "ready" when concept doc + screen spec + data model all pass.

STEP 4: Print readiness report

- Print readiness table (see references/report_templates.md)
- Print global prerequisite status line
- For each NOT-ready feature, list missing items with remediation command
- Print verdict: "X of Y features are ready for E2E testing"

STEP 5: Verdict message
IF all features ready > "All features ready. Run `e2e` with confidence."
ELSE IF some features ready > "Partial readiness. Run `e2e` only for ready features, or fix gaps first."
ELSE > "No features ready for E2E testing. Fix gaps above first."

MUST check every feature — never skip or sample
MUST show remediation command for each missing required item
NEVER modify any \_concept/ files — this is a read-only audit
NEVER report a feature as ready when any required check fails
