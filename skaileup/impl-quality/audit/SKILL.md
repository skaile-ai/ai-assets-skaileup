# Audit — Static Code Analysis

## Overview

The **audit** skill is the Static Code Auditor. It analyzes the codebase without
running it. It does not start servers or modify files (unless asked to fix an issue).
Its output is a prioritized bug/risk report.

## When to Use

- Source code exists and the user wants comprehensive code analysis
- The user says "audit the code", "security check", "find bugs"
- Before E2E testing to catch issues statically
- After significant code changes
- The orchestrator dispatches this as a quality gate

## When NOT to Use

- You want to audit the `_concept/` structure — use **review** instead
- You want to check feature readiness — use **ready** instead
- No source code exists — nothing to audit

## Prerequisites

**Hard gate:** None. Verifies source files exist during pre-flight; stops gracefully if none found.

## Context Budget

| Action         | Path                                                       | Required |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Must read**  | Source code files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.) | Yes      |
| **Optional**   | `_concept/` (for structure integrity check)                | No       |
| **Never load** | `_concept/_grounding/`, research files                     | —        |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                        | What to do instead                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Running the app to test        | Static analysis only. Use **e2e** for runtime testing.                      |
| Modifying files without asking | Present report first. Fix only when user says yes.                          |
| Missing structure check        | If `_concept/` exists, include lightweight structure integrity check.       |
| False positives on security    | Consider framework protections (CSRF tokens, sanitization) before flagging. |
| Overwhelming the user          | Prioritize. Show critical and high first. Batch medium and low.             |

ROLE Static Code Auditor — analyzes codebase without running it, produces prioritized bug/risk report.

READS
package.json / pyproject.toml — project exists (choose appropriate marker)
src/ or app/ or equivalent — source code to audit
? \_concept/\*_/_.md — structure integrity input (if \_concept/ exists)

WRITES
? audit-report.md — exported report (user opt-in)

REFERENCES
contracts/concept_structure.md — expected \_concept/ paths
contracts/frontmatter.md — required YAML fields
contracts/iron_laws.md — non-negotiable constraints
references/analysis_checklists.md — sub-agent checklists + report template

MUST never start servers or modify files unless user asks to fix
MUST wait for all three sub-agents before producing the report
NEVER modify source code without showing diff and getting confirmation

EMIT [audit] started run_id=<uuid>

# ── Pre-flight ──────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 1: Verify source exists

- Look for project markers: package.json, pyproject.toml, vite.config.ts, etc.
  IF no source files found
  - Report "No application source found to audit." and stop

# ── Phase 1: Parallel Analysis ──────────────────────────────

STEP 2: Launch three sub-agents (parallel)

- Sub-agent 1 — Logic & Runtime Errors
  See references/analysis_checklists.md § Logic & Runtime
- Sub-agent 2 — UI/UX & Accessibility
  See references/analysis_checklists.md § UI/UX & Accessibility
- Sub-agent 3 — Security & Data Integrity
  See references/analysis_checklists.md § Security & Data Integrity
- Wait for all three to complete
- Each sub-agent returns findings as severity-tagged list

EMIT [audit] checkpoint phase=analysis_complete critical=<C> high=<H> medium=<M> low=<L>

# ── Phase 2: Structure Integrity ────────────────────────────

STEP 3: Check \_concept/ structure
IF \_concept/ exists - Check cross-reference integrity (features <-> screens) - Check for orphaned files - Check frontmatter compliance - Check for stale files (last_updated > 30 days)
EMIT [audit] audit_pass check=cross_references
EMIT [audit] audit_warn check=stale_file file=<path> days=<N>
ELSE - Skip structure checks

# ── Phase 3: Consolidated Report ────────────────────────────

STEP 4: Produce report

- Merge findings from all sub-agents
- Sort by severity: Critical > High > Medium > Low
- Append structure integrity summary
- Format per references/analysis_checklists.md § Report Template

OUTPUT audit-report.md (user opt-in)

## Audit Report

### Critical (fix before shipping)

- [Description] — [file:line] — [category]

### High / Medium / Low ...

### Structure Integrity

- Cross-references: N valid, N broken

### Summary

Code issues: N Structure issues: N

# ── Phase 4: Offer Fixes ────────────────────────────────────

STEP 5: Ask user

> "Would you like me to fix any of these issues? I can start from critical."
> IF user says yes

    - Fix each issue one at a time
    - Show diff for each fix
    - Wait for confirmation before next fix
    UNTIL all accepted fixes applied

# ── Phase 5: Optional Export ────────────────────────────────

STEP 6: Offer export

> "Save report to audit-report.md?"
> IF user says yes

    - Write audit-report.md to project root

EMIT [audit] completed run_id=<uuid> issues=<N> critical=<C> high=<H> structure_issues=<S>

CHECKLIST

- [ ] All three sub-agents completed
- [ ] Findings sorted by severity
- [ ] Structure integrity included (when \_concept/ exists)
- [ ] Report presented to user
- [ ] No files modified without explicit approval
