# Features — Feature Planning

## Overview

The **features** skill is the Feature Planning agent. It derives features from
approved user journeys (`stories.yaml`) and the project brief, producing individual
feature files organized in numbered groups under `_concept/experience/features/`.

Features are the source of truth for screens and the data model. It does NOT write
screen specs, data models, brand, or tech stack.

## When to Use

- `_concept/experience/journeys/stories.yaml` exists and is approved
- The user says "define features", "what should the app do", "plan functionality"
- The orchestrator dispatches this after journeys are complete
- The user wants to redo or expand an existing feature set

## When NOT to Use

- No approved project brief or journeys yet — run **overview** then **journeys** first
- The user wants to design screens — use the **screens** skill (features must exist first)
- The user wants to define the data model — use the **datamodel** skill (features must exist first)
- Adding one new feature to an existing concept — use **add-feature** instead

## Prerequisites

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** Read `contracts/concept_structure.md`,
`contracts/frontmatter.md`, `contracts/feedback_loop.md`,
and `contracts/golden_principles.md` before proceeding.

**Hard gates:**

- `_concept/discovery/brief.md` must exist and be non-empty
- `_concept/experience/journeys/stories.yaml` must exist and be non-empty

## Context Budget

| Action           | Path                                                  | Required |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Must read        | `_concept/discovery/brief.md`                         | Yes      |
| Must read        | `_concept/discovery/goals.md`                         | Yes      |
| Must read        | `_concept/experience/journeys/stories.yaml`           | Yes      |
| Must read        | `references/feature_template.md`                      | Yes      |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/research/competitors.md`          | No       |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/research/audiences.md`            | No       |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/features/user_input.json`        | No       |
| Never load       | `_concept/experience/screens/`, `_concept/blueprint/` | —        |

## Standalone Mode

**Gate check:** Both brief.md and stories.yaml must exist.
**On completion:** Show summary table and present next steps (screens, datamodel, orchestrator).

ROLE Feature Planning agent — derives features from approved user journeys and the
project brief, producing feature files in numbered groups.

READS
\_concept/discovery/brief.md — app name, audience, scope
\_concept/discovery/goals.md — success criteria, constraints
\_concept/experience/journeys/stories.yaml — user journeys with candidate features
? \_concept/\_grounding/research/competitors.md — feature gaps from competitor analysis
? \_concept/\_grounding/research/audiences.md — user needs influencing priorities
? \_concept/\_grounding/features/user_input.json — pre-collected dialog answers

WRITES
\_concept/experience/features/<NN_group>/<feature>.md — one file per feature

REFERENCES
contracts/concept_structure.md — valid \_concept/ paths and naming rules
contracts/frontmatter.md — required YAML fields
contracts/feedback_loop.md — how downstream skills modify feature files
contracts/golden_principles.md — group naming, entity naming rules
references/feature_template.md — file template, identification questions

MUST organize features in numbered group folders (01_user_auth, 02_dashboard, etc.)
MUST include frontmatter: priority, story_refs, roles, permissions, agent_notes, screens, data_entities, last_updated
MUST include a story_refs field on every feature — traces back to stories.yaml stories
MUST leave screens[] and data_entities[] empty — populated by downstream skills via feedback loop
NEVER write screen specs, data models, brand, or tech stack files
NEVER populate screens[] or data_entities[] — those fields are filled by the screens and datamodel skills
NEVER invent features with no traceability to the brief or stories.yaml

EMIT [features] started run_id=<uuid>

STEP 1: Read context

- Read \_concept/discovery/brief.md
- Stop if missing or empty:
  > "No approved project brief found. Run `overview` first."
- Read \_concept/experience/journeys/stories.yaml
- Stop if missing or empty:
  > "No user journeys found. Run `journeys` first."
- Check \_grounding/features/user_input.json for pre-collected answers (feature_priorities, etc.)
- Extract candidate_features from all story downstream links
- Use story stages to set default feature priority:
  - hero flow stories → must-have features
  - vital journey stories → must-have features
  - hygiene flow stories → must-have features (but simpler scope)
  - backlog flow stories → nice-to-have features
- If feature_priorities user input is set, use it to calibrate scope:
  - "must-have features only" — skip all backlog-derived and nice-to-have candidates
  - "must-have + nice-to-have" — include hygiene and backlog candidates as nice-to-have (default)
  - "comprehensive" — include all candidates including backlog
    IF \_concept/\_grounding/research/ exists
  - Read competitors.md for feature gaps (if present)
  - Read audiences.md for user needs and priorities (if present)

STEP 2: Identify and group features

- Start from the candidate_features extracted from stories.yaml
- Group related candidates into feature groups (e.g. user authentication, task management)
- For each feature, answer the identification questions (see references/feature_template.md)
- Create numbered group folders using NN\_ prefix (no letter prefix):
  $ mkdir -p \_concept/experience/features/01_user_auth
- Write one feature file per feature using the template in references/feature_template.md

STEP 2b: Define roles and permissions

- Identify all user roles mentioned across the brief, goals, and stories
- For each feature, determine which roles can:
  - View / Read data
  - Create new records
  - Edit existing records
  - Delete records
  - Perform special actions (approve, assign, export, etc.)
- Write a ## Permissions section in each feature file with a role-action matrix
- Add permissions field to each feature's frontmatter

OUTPUT \_concept/experience/features/<NN_group>/<feature>.md

# Feature: <Name>

## Description

## User Benefit

STEP 3: Present summary

- Show summary table:
  | # | Feature | Group | Priority | Roles |
  |---|---------|-------|----------|-------|
  | 1 | Login | 01_user_auth | must-have | all_users |
  | 2 | Registration | 01_user_auth | must-have | all_users |
  | 3 | Dashboard | 02_dashboard | must-have | all_users |
- Include totals: N features (X must-have, Y nice-to-have)
- Show permissions overview across all features:
  | Feature | <role_1> | <role_2> | ... |
  |---------|----------|----------|-----|
  | <feat> | full | view | |

EMIT [features] checkpoint phase=features_written groups=<N> features=<total> must_have=<X> nice_to_have=<Y>

STEP 4: Human review
CHECKPOINT features_approved > "Does this feature list look complete? Add, rename, remove, or reprioritize anything before I continue."

UNTIL user approves

STEP 5: Hand off

> "Features approved. Next steps:
>
> - Run `screens` to specify the UI screens for these features
> - Run `datamodel` to design the data schema
> - Or run `concept-orchestrator` to continue the full pipeline"

EMIT [features] completed run_id=<uuid> feature_count=<N> groups=<N>

## Depth Behavior

| Depth    | Behavior                                                                                        |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`   | Skip this skill entirely                                                                        |
| `light`  | Core items only — list names and one-line descriptions, skip edge cases                         |
| `medium` | Standard coverage — full specs for core items, brief for secondary (default)                    |
| `max`    | Exhaustive coverage — every feature/screen/component with full detail, edge cases, error states |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                            | Why it happens                                                    | What to do instead                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Writing screen specs inside feature files          | Agent conflates "what the app does" with "what the UI looks like" | Features describe functionality and requirements. Screens are a separate skill.                                  |
| Missing story_refs on features                     | Agent creates features without linking to journeys                | Every feature must list which stories drive it. If you can't find a story, question whether the feature belongs. |
| Populating screens[] or data_entities[]            | Agent tries to be helpful and pre-fills downstream fields         | Leave these empty. They are populated by the screens and datamodel skills via the feedback loop.                 |
| Letter-prefixed group folders (A*01*)              | Agent follows old CF naming convention                            | Use NN\_ prefix only (01_user_auth, not A_01_user_auth).                                                         |
| Creating features not in the brief or stories      | Agent invents features from domain knowledge                      | Every feature must trace back to the brief's problem statement, audience, hero flow, or a story candidate.       |
| Inventing features from scratch when stories exist | Agent ignores candidate_features hints                            | Start from stories.yaml downstream.candidate_features — these are the journeys team's intent.                    |

## Research Mode

When research data exists, check before writing features:

- `_concept/_grounding/research/competitors.md` — competitor feature sets, gaps, differentiators
- `_concept/_grounding/research/audiences.md` — user needs influencing priorities and scope

If research data exists, use it to inform feature priorities and identify gaps.
If it does not exist, proceed from brief and stories alone.

**What this skill benefits from researching:** Competitor feature matrices,
common feature patterns for the app's domain, user workflow best practices,
accessibility requirements for the target audience.

## Integration

- **Called by:** `concept-orchestrator` or standalone (after journeys)
- **Requires:** `_concept/discovery/brief.md` and `_concept/experience/journeys/stories.yaml`
- **Feedback from downstream:**
  - **datamodel** skill populates `data_entities[]` in feature frontmatter
  - **screens** skill populates `screens[]` in feature frontmatter
- **Feeds into:** screens, datamodel — both depend on features existing
