## Feature identification questions

For each feature, answer:

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 1 | What should the user be able to do? |
| 2 | What happens when it works? When it fails? |
| 3 | Who uses this — everyone, or a specific role? |
| 4 | Must-have for launch, or nice-to-have? |
| 5 | Which stories in stories.yaml does this trace to? |

## Scope guidance

Focus feature specs on **custom business logic and non-standard flows**. Most
frameworks and platforms provide standard CRUD operations, list/detail views,
and admin UIs automatically — avoid speccing what your stack handles for free.

Ask: "Does this feature require custom logic, special UI treatment, or domain-specific
rules?" If yes, it belongs here. If it is a standard list or form, note it briefly
and move on.

## Summary table format

Present features in a summary table for user review:

```
| # | Feature | Group | Priority | Roles |
|---|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Login | 01_user_auth | must-have | all_users |
| 2 | Registration | 01_user_auth | must-have | all_users |
| 3 | Dashboard | 02_dashboard | must-have | all_users |
```
