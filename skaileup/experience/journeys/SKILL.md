# Journeys — User Journey Mapping

## Overview

The **journeys** skill is the Journey Mapping agent. It reads the approved project
brief and goals, then produces `_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json` — a
structured map of user personas, story maps organized by stage, and EARS acceptance
criteria for each story.

The journeys output is the single source of truth for the features skill: features
are _derived_ from stories, not invented from scratch.

## When to Use

- The project brief (`_concept/discovery/brief.md`) has been approved
- You need to define what users will do in the app before speccing features
- The orchestrator dispatches this as step 2 in the concept pipeline

## When NOT to Use

- `_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json` already exists and is approved
- No approved brief yet — run the **overview** skill first
- You want to add a specific feature — use **features** or **add-feature** directly

## Prerequisites

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** Read `contracts/concept_structure.md`,
`contracts/frontmatter.md`, and `contracts/acceptance_criteria.md`
before proceeding.

**Hard gate:** `_concept/discovery/brief.md` must exist and be non-empty.

## Context Budget

| Action           | Path                                                | Required |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Must read        | `_concept/discovery/brief.md`                       | Yes      |
| Must read        | `_concept/discovery/goals.md`                       | Yes      |
| Must read        | `references/ears_format.md`                         | Yes      |
| Must read        | `references/journey_stages.md`                      | Yes      |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/general/audiences.md`          | No       |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/general/competitors.md`        | No       |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/general/domain.md`             | No       |
| Never load       | `experience/features/`, `blueprint/`, or downstream | —        |

## Standalone Mode

**Gate check:** `_concept/discovery/brief.md` must exist.
**On completion:** Show summary table and present next steps (features, orchestrator).

---

ROLE Journey Mapping agent — reads the approved project brief and produces
`_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json` only.

READS
\_concept/discovery/brief.md — app name, audience, problem, hero_flow
\_concept/discovery/goals.md — success criteria, constraints, deadlines
? \_concept/\_grounding/general/audiences.md — detailed persona profiles from research
? \_concept/\_grounding/general/competitors.md — competitor flows and feature gaps
? \_concept/\_grounding/general/domain.md — domain terminology and workflows

WRITES
\_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json — personas, story maps, acceptance criteria

REFERENCES
contracts/concept_structure.md — valid \_concept/ paths and naming rules
contracts/frontmatter.md — required YAML fields
contracts/acceptance_criteria.md — EARS patterns and AC rules
contracts/stories_schema.json — JSON Schema for stories.json validation
references/ears_format.md — EARS syntax patterns and examples
references/journey_stages.md — hero / vital / hygiene / backlog definitions

MUST produce exactly one hero story map — the single most important user journey
MUST write EARS acceptance criteria for every story (minimum 2 per hero story, 1 per other)
MUST derive personas from brief audience and research (when available)
MUST validate stories.json against contracts/stories_schema.json before writing
MUST include downstream hints (candidate_features, candidate_entities, candidate_screens) for every story
MUST set status: proposed on all new stories
NEVER write feature files, screen specs, data models, or any artifact outside experience/journeys/
NEVER define more than one hero story map — hero is always exactly one
NEVER skip acceptance criteria — every story must have at least one EARS criterion

EMIT [journeys] started run_id=<uuid>

STEP 1: Read context

- Read \_concept/discovery/brief.md
- Stop if missing or empty:
  > "No approved project brief found. Run `overview` first."
- Read \_concept/discovery/goals.md for success criteria and constraints
- Extract: app name, problem, audience, hero_flow, success_metrics
  IF \_concept/\_grounding/general/ exists
  - Read audiences.md for detailed persona profiles (if present)
  - Read competitors.md for competitor user flows and gaps (if present)
  - Read domain.md for domain terminology and workflows (if present)

STEP 2: Define personas

- Identify distinct user types from brief audience field
  IF \_concept/\_grounding/general/audiences.md exists
  - Enrich personas with research findings (goals, pain points, context)
    ELSE
  - Derive personas from brief and goals alone
- Define 2–5 personas; each has:
  - id: slug (e.g. "ops-manager", "field-technician")
  - label: human-readable name (e.g. "Operations Manager")
  - goals: list of what this persona wants to achieve with the app
- Present persona list to user:
  > "I've identified these personas: [list with goals]. Add, remove, or adjust?"
- Wait for confirmation before proceeding

STEP 3: Map Hero Journey

- Use hero_flow from brief.md as the starting point
- Build a single story map representing the most important end-to-end user journey
- This is the journey that, if it fails, the app has no value
- Break the hero flow into 3–8 sequential stories; each has:
  - id: "story-<NNN>" (e.g. "story-001")
  - title: short action phrase
  - persona: references persona id
  - outcome: what the user achieves
  - priority: must (hero stories are always must)
  - status: proposed
  - acceptance_criteria: minimum 2 EARS criteria per story
  - review: { mode: "human_review" }
  - downstream: candidate_features, candidate_entities, candidate_screens
- Set story map stage: hero

CHECKPOINT hero_approved > "Here is the hero journey for [app name]: > [brief narrative of the end-to-end flow] > > Does this capture the core value loop? Confirm or suggest changes before > I map the remaining journeys."

UNTIL user approves - Apply requested changes - Show updated hero journey and ask for approval again

STEP 4: Map Vital Journeys

- Identify other critical user journeys needed for MVP scope
- These complement the hero flow and make the app viable for daily use
- Each vital story map covers a distinct user journey (e.g. "manage team", "view reports")
- Stories use priority must or should
- Include downstream hints for every story
- Set story map stage: vital

STEP 5: Map Hygiene Flows

- Identify admin and operational flows that enable the app to function
- Examples: user onboarding, settings configuration, data import/export, role management
- These are not the reason users buy the app, but the app cannot operate without them
- Stories use priority should or could
- Set story map stage: hygiene

STEP 6: Map Backlog Flows

- Capture future user journeys out of MVP scope
- Sources: competitor analysis gaps, nice-to-have ideas from brief, advanced workflows in goals.md
- Stories use priority could or wont
- Set story map stage: backlog

STEP 7: Write EARS acceptance criteria

- For every story across all story maps, write acceptance criteria using EARS patterns
- Use the appropriate EARS pattern for each criterion (see references/ears_format.md):
  - Ubiquitous: THE SYSTEM SHALL <action>
  - Event-driven: WHEN <trigger>, THE SYSTEM SHALL <action>
  - State-driven: IF <state>, THE SYSTEM SHALL <action>
  - Optional feature: WHERE <feature>, THE SYSTEM SHALL <action>
  - Complex: IF <state> AND WHEN <event>, THE SYSTEM SHALL <action>
- Each criterion: kind: "ears", text: <EARS statement>
- Optionally add gherkin_scenarios for complex stories that benefit from step-by-step spec

STEP 8: Write stories.json

- $ mkdir -p \_concept/experience/journeys
- Populate concept section from brief.md (name, problem, success_metrics)
- Set review.mode: human_review for hero and vital stories, auto_approve for hygiene and backlog

OUTPUT \_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json
{
"version": "1.0",
"concept": { "name": "<app>", "problem": "...", "success_metrics": [...] },
"personas": [{ "id": "...", "label": "...", "goals": [...] }],
"story_maps": [{
"id": "journey-<NNN>", "label": "...", "stage": "hero",
"stories": [{
"id": "story-<NNN>", "title": "...", "persona": "<persona-id>",
"outcome": "...", "priority": "must",
"status": "proposed",
"acceptance_criteria": [{ "kind": "ears", "text": "WHEN ... THE SYSTEM SHALL ..." }],
"review": { "mode": "human_review" },
"downstream": {
"candidate_features": ["..."],
"candidate_entities": ["..."],
"candidate_screens": ["..."]
}
}]
}]
}

- Validate against contracts/stories_schema.json

EMIT [journeys] checkpoint phase=stories_written personas=<N> story_maps=<N> stories=<total>

STEP 9: Present summary and get final approval

- Show summary table:

  | #     | Journey | Stage | Stories | Must | Should | Could | Wont |
  | ----- | ------- | ----- | ------- | ---- | ------ | ----- | ---- |
  | 1     | <label> | hero  | N       | N    | 0      | 0     | 0    |
  | 2     | <label> | vital | N       | N    | N      | 0     | 0    |
  | ...   |
  | Total | N       | N     | N       | N    | N      |

- Show persona summary: N personas defined
- Show acceptance criteria count: N EARS criteria across all stories
- Show downstream coverage: N candidate features, N candidate entities, N candidate screens

CHECKPOINT journeys_approved > "Here are your user journeys: > - Hero: [label] — the core flow that defines your app > - Vital: [N] journeys for MVP scope > - Hygiene: [N] operational flows > - Backlog: [N] future flows > > Total: [N] stories with [N] acceptance criteria. > Does this capture the right user experience? Add, remove, or reprioritize?"

UNTIL user approves

STEP 10: Hand off

> "User journeys approved. Next steps:
>
> - Run `features` to derive features from these journeys
> - Run `concept-orchestrator` to continue the full pipeline"

EMIT [journeys] completed run_id=<uuid> personas=<N> story_maps=<N> stories=<total> hero_stories=<N> acceptance_criteria=<N>

## Depth Behavior

| Depth    | Behavior                                                                                        |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`   | Skip this skill entirely                                                                        |
| `light`  | Core items only — list names and one-line descriptions, skip edge cases                         |
| `medium` | Standard coverage — full specs for core items, brief for secondary (default)                    |
| `max`    | Exhaustive coverage — every feature/screen/component with full detail, edge cases, error states |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                       | Why it happens                                    | What to do instead                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Defining more than one hero                   | Agent maps multiple "important" flows as hero     | Pick the single flow that defines the app's core value. Everything else is vital or hygiene.   |
| Skipping EARS criteria                        | Agent writes vague "system should work" criteria  | Every story must have at least one properly-formed EARS criterion. See ears_format.md.         |
| Hero journey not from brief.hero_flow         | Agent ignores the brief's hero_flow field         | Always start the hero journey from brief.md hero_flow. It is the approved core flow.           |
| Inventing competitor flows                    | No research was run, agent fills gaps             | If no research exists, derive journeys from brief alone. Do not fabricate competitor patterns. |
| Including downstream features in stories.json | Agent tries to be helpful and spec features early | Only include candidate hints (strings). Full feature specs are the features skill's job.       |
| Proceeding past hero CHECKPOINT               | Agent rushes to finish                            | Always wait for explicit user approval of the hero journey before mapping vital/hygiene.       |

## Integration

- **Called by:** `concept-orchestrator` or standalone (step 2 in the concept pipeline)
- **Requires:** `_concept/discovery/brief.md` to exist and be approved
- **Feeds into:** `features` skill reads `stories.json` to derive feature specs
- **Feedback loops:** None inbound. Features skill uses `story_refs` to link back.
