# Quality Domain — Shared Contract

**Do not invoke directly.** This is a dependency contract — all `impl-quality` skills read this before operating.

## Scope

Quality skills operate on both `_concept/` (structure audits) and source code (static analysis, tests). This contract defines their shared output formats and conventions.

## Skills Overview

| Skill | Trigger | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `audit` | code exists, user requests analysis | `_quality/audit-report.md`, `_quality/quality.yaml` |
| `ready` | before implementation starts | `_quality/readiness.yaml` |
| `sync` | broken cross-references detected | patches to `_concept/` frontmatter |
| `test-plan` | concept complete | `_concept/4_testing/test_plan.md` |
| `test-unit` | feature implemented | test files alongside source |
| `test-integration` | features complete | integration test suite |
| `e2e` | app deployed / staging env | e2e test suite (Playwright/Cypress) |
| `compile-validators` | schema files exist | compiled validator scripts |

## quality.yaml Format

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"
run_id: <uuid>
scored_at: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
scope: concept | code | full
score: 0-100
grades:
  structure: 0-100
  cross_refs: 0-100
  completeness: 0-100
  freshness: 0-100
issues:
  - severity: CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | INFO
    category: structure | cross_ref | stale | missing | orphan
    file: <path>
    message: <description>
    auto_fixable: true | false
```

## Audit Report Format

`_quality/audit-report.md`:
```markdown
# Audit Report — <scope>
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  **Run ID:** <uuid>  **Score:** NN/100

## Summary
<N CRITICAL, N HIGH, N MEDIUM, N LOW>

## Issues
### CRITICAL
- `path/to/file`: <description>

## Auto-fixable
<list of issues sync can repair>
```

## Test File Conventions

- Unit tests: co-located with source (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/` (Playwright preferred)
- Validators: `_quality/validators/`

## Quality Gate Thresholds

| Gate | Minimum score | Max blocking issues |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| Continue auto-review | 70 | 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH |
| Readiness (pre-implementation) | 80 | 0 CRITICAL |
| Deployment | 90 | 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH |

## Evaluation Round Output Schemas

The four evaluation rounds each produce a YAML file. All eval skills MUST write their output file before reporting to the user.

### eval-concept.yaml — `_concept/eval-concept.yaml`

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"
evaluated_at: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
completeness_score: 0
clarity_score: 0
traceability_score: 0
overall_score: 0
verdict: pass | needs_resolution | fail
blocking_flags:
  - type: missing | ambiguous | contradiction | orphan | untraceable
    severity: blocking
    location: <path to artifact>
    description: <quotes the problematic text>
    resolution: <what the user must do to fix this>
warning_flags: []
summary: <2-3 sentence assessment>
```

Overall score weights: completeness 0.4, clarity 0.35, traceability 0.25.
Verdict: pass = all three scores ≥ 80 AND no blocking flags / needs_resolution = score 60–79 or blocking flags / fail = any score < 60.

### eval-feature/{group}.yaml — `_implementation/eval-feature/{group-name}.yaml`

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"
evaluated_at: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
feature_group: <group name>
acceptance_criteria:
  - id: <feature_id>/<criterion_index>
    text: <criterion text>
    interaction: <what the evaluator did to test it>
    result: pass | fail | partial | untestable
    evidence: <screenshot path or description>
    deviation: <if fail/partial: what app did vs what spec says>
screen_fidelity_score: 0
journey_completable: "true | false | partial"
regression_issues: []
deviations: []
verdict: approved | needs_revision | escalate
revision_instructions: <specific actionable feedback if needs_revision>
```

Verdict thresholds: approved = ≥90% criteria pass + journey_completable=true + fidelity ≥80 + no regressions / needs_revision = 70–89% pass or fidelity 60–79 / escalate = <70% pass or regressions or critical criterion failed.

### eval-product.yaml — `_implementation/eval-product.yaml`

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"
evaluated_at: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
goals:
  - goal: <text>
    achieved: achieved | partial | not_achieved
    evidence: <description>
design:
  quality: 0
  originality: 0
  craft: 0
  functionality: 0
  notes: <specific observations per dimension>
performance:
  lcp_ms: 0
  cls: 0.0
  first_interaction_ms: 0
accessibility_score: 0
mobile_score: 0
improvement_priorities:
  - <ranked list>
verdict: approved | needs_iteration | fail
```

Verdict: approved = ≥2/3 goals achieved/partial + design average ≥7 + accessibility ≥70 + LCP <4s / needs_iteration = any goal not_achieved or design avg <7 / fail = majority goals not_achieved.

Design rubrics (0–10 each):
- **Quality**: coherent experience vs. disconnected components — 9-10 requires intentional visual hierarchy
- **Originality**: distinctive identity vs. AI defaults — penalise purple/blue gradients, generic card grids, default Tailwind palette, generic hero sections
- **Craft**: typography, spacing, color harmony, consistency
- **Functionality**: every UI element serves a clear user purpose

### eval-code.yaml — `_implementation/eval-code.yaml`

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"
evaluated_at: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
scope: scaffold | feature | full
build:
  lint: pass | fail
  types: pass | fail
  bundle: pass | fail
tests:
  pass: 0
  fail: 0
  skip: 0
  coverage_lines: 0
logic:
  score: 0
  findings:
    - severity: critical|high|medium|low
      location: <file:line>
      description: "..."
      fix: "..."
security:
  score: 0
  findings: []
ui_ux:
  score: 0
  findings: []
blocking_issues: []
verdict: pass | warn | fail
```

Verdict: pass = build clean + tests pass + no critical/high findings / warn = medium findings only / fail = build fails OR tests fail OR any critical finding.
Scopes: scaffold = build+lint+types only / feature = +unit tests / full = +parallel logic/security/ui_ux sub-agents.
