# Data Model

## Overview

The **datamodel** skill is the Data Model agent. It analyzes approved features and
produces a stack-independent data model using semantic types. It outputs:

- `model.dbml` — human-readable entity definitions (DBML syntax)
- `model.json` — editor-native format (visual canvas state)
- `seed.json` — scenario-based test data (empty, single_user, populated, edge_cases)
- `feature_map.json` — model-to-feature cross-reference

The model uses **semantic types** (from `skaileup-contracts/contracts/semantic_types.md`), not
SQL types. Stack translation (Prisma, Directus schema, SQL DDL) is a separate on-request step.

## When to Use

- Features are approved but `_concept/blueprint/datamodel/` is empty
- User asks about entities, tables, relationships, database schema
- User says "data model", "what data do we need", "database design"

## When NOT to Use

- Features have not been written or approved yet — run **features** first
- User wants to change specific existing model fields — edit directly
- User wants a stack-specific schema output only — use stack translation as a follow-up

## Prerequisites

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** Read `skaileup-contracts/contracts/concept_structure.md`,
`skaileup-contracts/contracts/semantic_types.md`, `skaileup-contracts/contracts/golden_principles.md`,
`skaileup-contracts/contracts/feedback_loop.md`, and `skaileup-contracts/contracts/seed_data.md`.

**Hard gates:**

- `_concept/experience/features/` must contain at least one feature file
- `_concept/blueprint/techstack.md` must exist

## Context Budget

| Action           | Path                                                        | Required        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Must read        | `_concept/discovery/brief.md`                               | Yes             |
| Must read        | `_concept/experience/features/**/*.md`                      | Yes             |
| Must read        | `_concept/blueprint/techstack.md`                           | Yes             |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/overview/user_input.json`              | No (complexity) |
| Check if present | `_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json`                 | No              |
| Check if present | `_concept/blueprint/architecture.md`                        | No              |
| Check if present | `_concept/experience/behaviors/*.allium`                    | No              |
| Check if present | `_concept/_grounding/general/patterns.md`                   | No              |
| Never load       | `_concept/experience/screens/`, `_concept/discovery/brand/` | —               |

## Standalone Mode

**Gate check:** At least one feature file + stack.md must exist.
**On completion:** Present model summary and suggest next steps (screens, architecture).

EMIT [datamodel] started run_id=<uuid>

STEP 1: Read context

- Read brief.md for app name and domain
- Read all feature files for functional requirements
- Read stack.md for backend constraints (informs translation hints only)
- Check \_grounding/overview/user_input.json for complexity field
  IF \_concept/experience/journeys/stories.json exists
  - Read stories.json; derive state machines from EARS acceptance criteria: - Event-driven criteria (WHEN ... THE SYSTEM SHALL ...) → state transitions - State-driven criteria (IF status is X ...) → guard conditions - Story downstream.candidate_entities hints → model candidates
    IF \_concept/blueprint/architecture.md exists
  - Note custom modules → may need their own entities or configuration models
  - Note communication protocols → may need session, message, or event models
  - Note external integrations → may need connection or credential models
    IF \_concept/experience/behaviors/\*.allium exists
  - Read all .allium files for formal entity definitions, state enums, transition rules
  - Allium states → enum values; Allium relationships → model relations
    IF \_concept/\_grounding/general/patterns.md exists
  - Read domain-specific data patterns for entity structure and relationship guidance

STEP 1b: Determine involvement level

- Read complexity from \_grounding/overview/user_input.json (default: standard)
  IF complexity is "small"
  - > "I'll design the data model automatically based on your features. I'll show you a summary when done. Want to review the details instead?"
  - Proceed in automatic mode → skip to STEP 3
    IF complexity is "complex"
  - > "The data model shapes how your app stores information. I recommend we design it together — or I can propose something and you review?"
  - Default to involved mode → continue to STEP 2
    ELSE (standard)
  - > "Would you like to be involved in data model design, or should I handle it based on your features?"

STEP 2: Analyze features (involved mode)

- For each feature identify: data created/read/updated/deleted, entities, relationships, enums
- Ask the user:
  1. For each feature: what information does it need to store?
  2. How are things connected? (e.g., "a user has many tasks")
  3. Who should be able to see or change what? (roles/permissions)
- If user is uncertain, analyze features and propose what is needed

STEP 3: Write DBML

- $ mkdir -p \_concept/blueprint/datamodel
- Write model.dbml with semantic types (see references/model_conventions.md)

OUTPUT \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.dbml
Use DBML syntax with semantic types. Example:
Table user {
id uuid [pk]
email email [unique, not null]
display_name string [not null]
role user_role [default: 'Member']
avatar image
created_at datetime [not null]
}
Table task {
id uuid [pk]
title string [not null]
status task_status [default: 'Todo']
assigned_to_id uuid [ref: > user.id]
due_date date
}
Enum user_role { Admin Member }
Enum task_status { Todo InProgress Done }

STEP 4: Write model.json

- Write model.json as the editor-native format (see references/model_conventions.md)

OUTPUT _concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json
{
"version": "1.0",
"editor": { "viewport": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "zoom": 1 } },
"entities": [{
"id": "<snake_case_name>",
"display_name": "<PascalCase>",
"icon": "<icon>",
"color": "<hex>",
"position": { "x": N, "y": N },
"from_features": ["experience/features/<group>/<feature>.md"],
"fields": [
{ "id": "<entity>_<field>", "name": "<snake*case>", "type": "<semantic_type>", ... }
]
}],
"relationships": [{
"id": "rel*<from>\_<to>",
"from": "<entity_id>", "from_field": "<field_id>",
"to": "<entity_id>", "type": "m2o|o2m|m2m",
"label": "...", "inverse_label": "...",
"required": false, "on_delete": "set_null|cascade|restrict"
}],
"enums": [{
"id": "<enum_id>",
"values": [{ "value": "<PascalCase>", "label": "<human label>" }]
}]
}

STEP 5: Write seed data

- Read skaileup-contracts/contracts/seed_data.md for scenario format and quality rules
- Write seed.json using canonical format (singular snake_case entity keys, PascalCase enum values)
- Must include all four scenarios: empty, single_user, populated, edge_cases
- Add "permissions" scenario if the app has role-based features
- Include a dev/test user in single_user and populated scenarios
- Use names from different locales, vary string lengths, include special characters
- IDs must be consistent across entities (relations must resolve)

OUTPUT \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/seed.json
See skaileup-contracts/contracts/seed_data.md for full format and examples.

STEP 6: Write feature_map.json

- Cross-reference every entity back to the feature(s) that require it

OUTPUT \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/feature_map.json
{
"<PascalCaseModel>": ["experience/features/<group>/<feature>.md", ...]
}

- Every entity must map to at least one feature; question any entity without a feature source

STEP 7: Update feature frontmatter (feedback loop)

- For each feature, update its data_entities[] with the entity names that serve it:
  data_entities: [user, task]
  EMIT [datamodel] feedback_loop updated <feature-path> set data_entities: [<entities>]

EMIT [datamodel] checkpoint phase=datamodel_written entities=<N> enums=<N> features_updated=<N>

STEP 8: Human approval
CHECKPOINT datamodel_approved
Show business summary: > "Your app will keep track of [primary entities in plain language]. > [Describe key relationships naturally]: Each [thing] can have multiple [related things]. > > Technical summary: > Entities: N, Relationships: N, Enums: N, Features updated: N > > Approve, or tell me what to change."

UNTIL user explicitly approves

STEP 9: Stack translation (on request only)
IF user asks "generate Prisma schema", "export to Directus", "SQL DDL", etc.: - Read stack.md to confirm the target - Use semantic_types.md translation table - Write stack-specific output (separate file, not a replacement for model.json) - Directus: collection snapshot JSON - Prisma: schema.prisma - Supabase: SQL migration - Raw SQL: PostgreSQL DDL

STEP 10: Hand off

> "Data model approved. Next steps:
>
> - Run `screens` to spec the UI (now data entities are defined)
> - Run `concept-orchestrator` to continue the full pipeline"

EMIT [datamodel] completed run_id=<uuid> entities=<N> relationships=<N> features_updated=<N>

CHECKLIST

- [ ] \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/model.json exists with all entities and relationships
- [ ] \_concept/blueprint/datamodel/seed.json has all four scenarios (empty, single_user, populated, edge_cases)

## Depth Behavior

| Depth    | Behavior                                                                          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`   | Skip this skill entirely                                                          |
| `light`  | Key decisions only — technology names, brief rationale                            |
| `medium` | Standard documentation — decisions with reasoning, diagrams, trade-offs (default) |
| `max`    | Comprehensive documentation — full ADRs, alternative analysis, migration paths    |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                             | What to do instead                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Using SQL types (VARCHAR, INT)      | Use semantic types only: string, integer, boolean, etc. Stack translation is a separate step.                                                    |
| Feature list = entity list          | Features and entities are not 1:1. Multiple features share entities, and infrastructure entities (audit logs, sessions) serve no single feature. |
| Skipping behavioral specs           | .allium files are authoritative for state machines. Enum values from allium must match exactly.                                                  |
| Empty seed.json                     | All four scenarios are required. Screens and E2E tests use them immediately.                                                                     |
| Omitting feature_map.json           | Every entity must trace to a feature. Entities without a source are likely unnecessary.                                                          |
| PascalCase or camelCase field names | Fields must be snake_case in the semantic layer (golden_principles).                                                                             |

## Research Mode

Check before writing the model:

- `_concept/_grounding/general/patterns.md` — domain-specific data patterns, entity structure conventions

## Integration

- **Called by:** `concept-orchestrator` or standalone (after features)
- **Requires:** features + techstack
- **Feedback loop:**
  - Feature `data_entities[]` populated (forward link from datamodel)
- **Feeds into:** `screens` (entities inform Information Displayed), `seed` (uses seed.json), `scaffold` (uses model.json for entity generation)
