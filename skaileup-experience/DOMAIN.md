# skaileup-experience

Defining what users see and do — user journeys, feature specifications, behavioral specs, screen designs, and component catalogs. Experience skills translate discovery artifacts into concrete user-facing design decisions, producing the specifications that prototype, storybook, and build skills consume.

Skills will be moved into this domain during the architecture reorganization (Phase 5.2+).

## Building Blocks

| Folder    | Purpose                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `skills/` | Invocable skills (see below) |

## Skills (target)

| Skill                         | Purpose                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `skaileup-journeys/`          | Maps end-to-end user journeys across the product                    |
| `skaileup-features/`          | Defines feature specifications with acceptance criteria             |
| `skaileup-behaviors/`         | Specifies interaction behaviors, states, and edge cases             |
| `skaileup-screens/`           | Designs screen layouts and information architecture                 |
| `skaileup-screens-technical/` | Adds technical constraints and component bindings to screen designs |
| `skaileup-components/`        | Catalogs reusable UI components and their variants                  |

## Conventions

- Experience skills depend on `_concept/10_discovery/` artifacts; run discovery first.
- Skills within this domain can run sequentially (journeys → features → behaviors → screens → components) or selectively depending on project scope.
- Output is written to `_concept/20_experience/`; prototype, storybook, and build skills read from this path.
